*Ankan Aich,Yangming Lee*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出一种基于Depth Anything V2架构的单目深度估计方法，通过DV-LORA高效适配医学内镜场景，在SCARED数据集上实现SOTA性能


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有自监督方法在具有镜面反射和充满液体的内镜环境中表现脆弱，特别是在薄手术工具和透明表面容易出现边界崩溃问题

Method: 利用Depth Anything V2架构的高保真合成先验，通过动态向量低秩适应(DV-LORA)高效适配医学领域，最小化参数预算并弥合合成到真实的差距

Result: 在SCARED数据集上建立新的SOTA，准确度(<1.25)达到98.1%，平方相对误差比现有基线降低超过17%，在不利手术光照条件下表现出卓越鲁棒性

Conclusion: 通过结合Depth Anything V2的几何先验和DV-LORA的高效适配，显著提升了内镜单目深度估计在镜面反射环境中的性能

Abstract: Accurate Monocular Depth Estimation (MDE) is critical for robotic surgery but remains fragile in specular, fluid-filled endoscopic environments. Existing self-supervised methods, typically relying on foundation models trained with noisy real-world pseudo-labels, often suffer from boundary collapse on thin surgical tools and transparent surfaces. In this work, we address this by leveraging the high-fidelity synthetic priors of the Depth Anything V2 architecture, which inherently captures precise geometric details of thin structures. We efficiently adapt these priors to the medical domain using Dynamic Vector Low-Rank Adaptation (DV-LORA), minimizing the parameter budget while bridging the synthetic-to-real gap. Additionally, we introduce a physically-stratified evaluation protocol on the SCARED dataset to rigorously quantify performance in high-specularity regimes often masked by aggregate metrics. Our approach establishes a new state-of-the-art, achieving an accuracy (< 1.25) of 98.1% and reducing Squared Relative Error by over 17% compared to established baselines, demonstrating superior robustness in adverse surgical lighting.

TL;DR: 提出基于视频的评估管道，利用计算机视觉从训练视频中提取性能分析，无需额外硬件，通过特定任务指标评估心理运动流畅性、情境意识和团队协调能力。

Abstract: Effective urban warfare training requires situational awareness and muscle memory, developed through repeated practice in realistic yet controlled environments. A key drill, Enter and Clear the Room (ECR), demands threat assessment, coordination, and securing confined spaces. The military uses Synthetic Training Environments that offer scalable, controlled settings for repeated exercises. However, automatic performance assessment remains challenging, particularly when aiming for objective evaluation of cognitive, psychomotor, and teamwork skills. Traditional methods often rely on costly, intrusive sensors or subjective human observation, limiting scalability and accuracy. This paper introduces a video-based assessment pipeline that derives performance analytics from training videos without requiring additional hardware. By utilizing computer vision models, the system extracts 2D skeletons, gaze vectors, and movement trajectories. From these data, we develop task-specific metrics that measure psychomotor fluency, situational awareness, and team coordination. These metrics feed into an extended Cognitive Task Analysis (CTA) hierarchy, which employs a weighted combination to generate overall performance scores for teamwork and cognition. We demonstrate the approach with a case study of real-world ECR drills, providing actionable, domain specific metrics that capture individual and team performance. We also discuss how these insights can support After Action Reviews with interactive dashboards within Gamemaster and the Generalized Intelligent Framework for Tutoring (GIFT), providing intuitive and understandable feedback. We conclude by addressing limitations, including tracking difficulties, ground-truth validation, and the broader applicability of our approach. Future work includes expanding analysis to 3D video data and leveraging video analysis to enable scalable evaluation within STEs.

### [3] [Lifelong Domain Adaptive 3D Human Pose Estimation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.23860)
*Qucheng Peng,Hongfei Xue,Pu Wang,Chen Chen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种终身域自适应3D人体姿态估计新任务，通过创新的GAN框架解决非平稳目标域数据集的适应和灾难性遗忘问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 3D人体姿态估计在真实场景中的泛化能力受限，现有域自适应方法无法处理非平稳目标域数据集，需要解决连续适应多个目标域时的灾难性遗忘问题。

Method: 提出终身域自适应3D HPE新任务，设计包含3D姿态生成器、2D姿态判别器和3D姿态估计器的GAN框架，集成姿态感知、时间感知和域感知知识来增强当前域适应并缓解遗忘。

Result: 在多个域自适应3D HPE数据集上的广泛实验表明，该方法在适应当前域和保留先前域知识方面表现出优越性能。

Conclusion: 该研究首次将终身域自适应引入3D HPE任务，提出的GAN框架有效解决了域偏移对齐和灾难性遗忘问题，为真实场景中的3D姿态估计提供了新思路。

Abstract: 3D Human Pose Estimation (3D HPE) is vital in various applications, from person re-identification and action recognition to virtual reality. However, the reliance on annotated 3D data collected in controlled environments poses challenges for generalization to diverse in-the-wild scenarios. Existing domain adaptation (DA) paradigms like general DA and source-free DA for 3D HPE overlook the issues of non-stationary target pose datasets. To address these challenges, we propose a novel task named lifelong domain adaptive 3D HPE. To our knowledge, we are the first to introduce the lifelong domain adaptation to the 3D HPE task. In this lifelong DA setting, the pose estimator is pretrained on the source domain and subsequently adapted to distinct target domains. Moreover, during adaptation to the current target domain, the pose estimator cannot access the source and all the previous target domains. The lifelong DA for 3D HPE involves overcoming challenges in adapting to current domain poses and preserving knowledge from previous domains, particularly combating catastrophic forgetting. We present an innovative Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) framework, which incorporates 3D pose generators, a 2D pose discriminator, and a 3D pose estimator. This framework effectively mitigates domain shifts and aligns original and augmented poses. Moreover, we construct a novel 3D pose generator paradigm, integrating pose-aware, temporal-aware, and domain-aware knowledge to enhance the current domain's adaptation and alleviate catastrophic forgetting on previous domains. Our method demonstrates superior performance through extensive experiments on diverse domain adaptive 3D HPE datasets.

### [4] [MRI-to-CT Synthesis With Cranial Suture Segmentations Using A Variational Autoencoder Framework](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.23894)
*Krithika Iyer,Austin Tapp,Athelia Paulli,Gabrielle Dickerson,Syed Muhammad Anwar,Natasha Lepore,Marius George Linguraru*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出基于深度学习的儿科MRI转合成CT框架，实现颅骨分割和骨缝可视化，填补MRI无法显示骨结构的空白。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 儿科颅骨发育和骨缝骨化评估对诊断生长相关颅脑疾病至关重要。CT虽有辐射风险，MRI无法显示颅骨和骨缝结构，需要一种无辐射且能评估骨结构的方法。

Method: 开发深度学习驱动的管道，将T1加权MRI转换为合成CT，预测详细的颅骨分割，生成骨缝概率热图，并从热图中直接分割骨缝。使用特定领域的变分自编码器。

Result: 合成CT与真实CT的结构相似度达99%，Fréchet inception距离为1.01。颅骨分割在七个颅骨区域平均Dice系数达85%，骨缝分割Dice系数达80%。TOST检验证实合成CT与真实CT在分割结果上等效。

Conclusion: 这是首个能从MRI生成合成CT并进行骨缝分割的儿科颅骨框架，结合了特定领域变分自编码器，生成与真实CT感知无法区分的合成CT，填补了无创颅骨评估的关键空白。

Abstract: Quantifying normative pediatric cranial development and suture ossification is crucial for diagnosing and treating growth-related cephalic disorders. Computed tomography (CT) is widely used to evaluate cranial and sutural deformities; however, its ionizing radiation is contraindicated in children without significant abnormalities. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) offers radiation free scans with superior soft tissue contrast, but unlike CT, MRI cannot elucidate cranial sutures, estimate skull bone density, or assess cranial vault growth. This study proposes a deep learning driven pipeline for transforming T1 weighted MRIs of children aged 0.2 to 2 years into synthetic CTs (sCTs), predicting detailed cranial bone segmentation, generating suture probability heatmaps, and deriving direct suture segmentation from the heatmaps. With our in-house pediatric data, sCTs achieved 99% structural similarity and a Frechet inception distance of 1.01 relative to real CTs. Skull segmentation attained an average Dice coefficient of 85% across seven cranial bones, and sutures achieved 80% Dice. Equivalence of skull and suture segmentation between sCTs and real CTs was confirmed using two one sided tests (TOST p < 0.05). To our knowledge, this is the first pediatric cranial CT synthesis framework to enable suture segmentation on sCTs derived from MRI, despite MRI's limited depiction of bone and sutures. By combining robust, domain specific variational autoencoders, our method generates perceptually indistinguishable cranial sCTs from routine pediatric MRIs, bridging critical gaps in non invasive cranial evaluation.

### [5] [Nonlinear Noise2Noise for Efficient Monte Carlo Denoiser Training](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.24794)
*Andrew Tinits,Stephen Mann*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出一种理论框架，允许在Noise2Noise训练中对噪声目标应用特定非线性函数而不引入显著偏差，解决了HDR图像去噪中因异常值导致的训练问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Noise2Noise方法虽然能使用噪声目标图像进行训练，但非线性函数会使噪声目标的期望值与干净目标不同，从而产生偏差。这在处理HDR图像时尤为突出，因为常用的色调映射等非线性预处理方法原本被认为与Noise2Noise训练不兼容。

Method: 开发理论框架分析非线性函数的影响，识别出一类引入最小偏差的非线性函数。针对HDR图像去噪问题，研究特定损失函数与色调映射函数的组合，在减少动态范围的同时最小化偏差。将此方法应用于现有的基于机器学习的蒙特卡洛去噪器。

Result: 该方法能够有效处理HDR图像中的异常值问题，使用仅含噪声的训练数据就能达到接近原始实现（使用高采样参考图像训练）的性能。

Conclusion: 某些非线性函数可以在Noise2Noise训练中应用而不引入显著偏差，这扩展了Noise2Noise方法的适用性，使其能够处理HDR图像等需要非线性预处理的场景。

Abstract: The Noise2Noise method allows for training machine learning-based denoisers with pairs of input and target images where both the input and target can be noisy. This removes the need for training with clean target images, which can be difficult to obtain. However, Noise2Noise training has a major limitation: nonlinear functions applied to the noisy targets will skew the results. This bias occurs because the nonlinearity makes the expected value of the noisy targets different from the clean target image. Since nonlinear functions are common in image processing, avoiding them limits the types of preprocessing that can be performed on the noisy targets. Our main insight is that certain nonlinear functions can be applied to the noisy targets without adding significant bias to the results. We develop a theoretical framework for analyzing the effects of these nonlinearities, and describe a class of nonlinear functions with minimal bias.
  We demonstrate our method on the denoising of high dynamic range (HDR) images produced by Monte Carlo rendering. Noise2Noise training can have trouble with HDR images, where the training process is overwhelmed by outliers and performs poorly. We consider a commonly used method of addressing these training issues: applying a nonlinear tone mapping function to the model output and target images to reduce their dynamic range. This method was previously thought to be incompatible with Noise2Noise training because of the nonlinearities involved. We show that certain combinations of loss functions and tone mapping functions can reduce the effect of outliers while introducing minimal bias. We apply our method to an existing machine learning-based Monte Carlo denoiser, where the original implementation was trained with high-sample count reference images. Our results approach those of the original implementation, but are produced using only noisy training data.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出MGML框架解决多模态MRI数据不完整时的脑肿瘤分割问题，通过元参数化自适应模态融合和一致性正则化模块，在不改变原模型架构的情况下提升分割性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 临床实践中多模态MRI数据常不完整，难以充分利用可用信息，因此最大化利用不完整多模态信息成为关键研究挑战。

Method: 提出元引导多模态学习框架，包含元参数化自适应模态融合和一致性正则化模块。Meta-AMF根据可用模态生成自适应软标签监督信号，促进更一致的多模态融合；一致性正则化模块增强分割性能并提升框架鲁棒性和泛化能力。

Result: 在BraTS2020和BraTS2023数据集上实验，相比多种先进方法表现更优。在BraTS2020上，15种缺失模态组合的平均Dice分数：全肿瘤87.55，肿瘤核心79.36，增强肿瘤62.67。

Conclusion: MGML框架能有效处理不完整多模态MRI数据，提升脑肿瘤分割性能，且不改变原模型架构，可方便集成到训练流程中进行端到端优化。

Abstract: Leveraging multimodal information from Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) plays a vital role in lesion segmentation, especially for brain tumors. However, in clinical practice, multimodal MRI data are often incomplete, making it challenging to fully utilize the available information. Therefore, maximizing the utilization of this incomplete multimodal information presents a crucial research challenge. We present a novel meta-guided multi-modal learning (MGML) framework that comprises two components: meta-parameterized adaptive modality fusion and consistency regularization module. The meta-parameterized adaptive modality fusion (Meta-AMF) enables the model to effectively integrate information from multiple modalities under varying input conditions. By generating adaptive soft-label supervision signals based on the available modalities, Meta-AMF explicitly promotes more coherent multimodal fusion. In addition, the consistency regularization module enhances segmentation performance and implicitly reinforces the robustness and generalization of the overall framework. Notably, our approach does not alter the original model architecture and can be conveniently integrated into the training pipeline for end-to-end model optimization. We conducted extensive experiments on the public BraTS2020 and BraTS2023 datasets. Compared to multiple state-of-the-art methods from previous years, our method achieved superior performance. On BraTS2020, for the average Dice scores across fifteen missing modality combinations, building upon the baseline, our method obtained scores of 87.55, 79.36, and 62.67 for the whole tumor (WT), the tumor core (TC), and the enhancing tumor (ET), respectively. We have made our source code publicly available at https://github.com/worldlikerr/MGML.

TL;DR: 提出基于AI的微血管吻合术自动动作分割与技能评估框架，实现92.4%的动作分割准确率和85.5%的技能分类准确率


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 神经外科微血管吻合术需要精细操作技能，传统评估依赖专家主观评分，存在评分者间变异性和时间成本高的问题，需要自动化、可扩展的客观评估方案

Method: 提出三模块AI框架：1) 基于YOLO和DeepSORT的器械尖端跟踪定位；2) 基于自相似矩阵的动作边界检测和无监督聚类；3) 监督分类模块评估手术手势熟练度

Conclusion: 该框架能为显微外科教育提供客观实时反馈，实现标准化、数据驱动的训练协议，提升高风险手术环境中的能力评估

Abstract: Proficiency in microanastomosis is a critical surgical skill in neurosurgery, where the ability to precisely manipulate fine instruments is crucial to successful outcomes. These procedures require sustained attention, coordinated hand movements, and highly refined motor skills, underscoring the need for objective and systematic methods to evaluate and enhance microsurgical training. Conventional assessment approaches typically rely on expert raters supervising the procedures or reviewing surgical videos, which is an inherently subjective process prone to inter-rater variability, inconsistency, and significant time investment. These limitations highlight the necessity for automated and scalable solutions. To address this challenge, we introduce a novel AI-driven framework for automated action segmentation and performance assessment in microanastomosis procedures, designed to operate efficiently on edge computing platforms. The proposed system comprises three main components: (1) an object tip tracking and localization module based on YOLO and DeepSORT; (2) an action segmentation module leveraging self-similarity matrix for action boundary detection and unsupervised clustering; and (3) a supervised classification module designed to evaluate surgical gesture proficiency. Experimental validation on a dataset of 58 expert-rated microanastomosis videos demonstrates the effectiveness of our approach, achieving a frame-level action segmentation accuracy of 92.4% and an overall skill classification accuracy of 85.5% in replicating expert evaluations. These findings demonstrate the potential of the proposed method to provide objective, real-time feedback in microsurgical education, thereby enabling more standardized, data-driven training protocols and advancing competency assessment in high-stakes surgical environments.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: T2VAttack：针对文本到视频扩散模型的对抗攻击研究，从语义和时间两个角度评估模型鲁棒性，发现即使微小提示修改也能显著降低生成质量


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管文本到视频扩散模型在生成高质量、时间连贯的视频方面取得了显著进展，但其对抗攻击的脆弱性尚未得到充分研究。考虑到视频数据的动态特性，需要从语义和时间两个维度评估模型的鲁棒性。

Method: 提出T2VAttack框架，包含两种攻击目标（语义目标评估视频-文本对齐，时间目标评估时间动态）和两种攻击方法：T2VAttack-S（识别关键词并用同义词贪婪替换）和T2VAttack-I（迭代插入优化词实现最小提示扰动）。在多个SOTA T2V模型上进行综合评估。

Result: 实验表明，即使微小的提示修改（如替换或插入单个词）也能导致语义保真度和时间动态的显著退化，揭示了当前T2V扩散模型的关键脆弱性。

Conclusion: 该研究首次全面探索了T2V扩散模型的对抗攻击脆弱性，提出的T2VAttack框架有效暴露了模型在语义和时间维度上的安全漏洞，为未来鲁棒T2V模型的开发提供了重要见解。

Abstract: The rapid evolution of Text-to-Video (T2V) diffusion models has driven remarkable advancements in generating high-quality, temporally coherent videos from natural language descriptions. Despite these achievements, their vulnerability to adversarial attacks remains largely unexplored. In this paper, we introduce T2VAttack, a comprehensive study of adversarial attacks on T2V diffusion models from both semantic and temporal perspectives. Considering the inherently dynamic nature of video data, we propose two distinct attack objectives: a semantic objective to evaluate video-text alignment and a temporal objective to assess the temporal dynamics. To achieve an effective and efficient attack process, we propose two adversarial attack methods: (i) T2VAttack-S, which identifies semantically or temporally critical words in prompts and replaces them with synonyms via greedy search, and (ii) T2VAttack-I, which iteratively inserts optimized words with minimal perturbation to the prompt. By combining these objectives and strategies, we conduct a comprehensive evaluation on the adversarial robustness of several state-of-the-art T2V models, including ModelScope, CogVideoX, Open-Sora, and HunyuanVideo. Our experiments reveal that even minor prompt modifications, such as the substitution or insertion of a single word, can cause substantial degradation in semantic fidelity and temporal dynamics, highlighting critical vulnerabilities in current T2V diffusion models.

Motivation: 现有视点外推方法依赖LiDAR点云、3D边界框和车道标注等先验信息，需要昂贵传感器或人工标注，限制了实际部署应用

Method: 1) 仅使用图像和可选相机位姿估计全局静态点云和逐帧动态点云；2) 使用可变形4D高斯框架重建场景；3) 初始训练的4D高斯模型生成降质伪图像训练视频扩散模型；4) 渐进偏移的高斯渲染通过扩散模型迭代优化，增强结果作为4DGS训练数据；5) 重复直到外推到目标视点

Conclusion: 该方法通过4D高斯模型与视频扩散模型的协同迭代优化，实现了仅需图像输入的高质量视点外推，降低了对昂贵传感器和标注数据的依赖

Abstract: This paper presents an effective solution for view extrapolation in autonomous driving scenarios. Recent approaches focus on generating shifted novel view images from given viewpoints using diffusion models. However, these methods heavily rely on priors such as LiDAR point clouds, 3D bounding boxes, and lane annotations, which demand expensive sensors or labor-intensive labeling, limiting applicability in real-world deployment. In this work, with only images and optional camera poses, we first estimate a global static point cloud and per-frame dynamic point clouds, fusing them into a unified representation. We then employ a deformable 4D Gaussian framework to reconstruct the scene. The initially trained 4D Gaussian model renders degraded and pseudo-images to train a video diffusion model. Subsequently, progressively shifted Gaussian renderings are iteratively refined by the diffusion model,and the enhanced results are incorporated back as training data for 4DGS. This process continues until extrapolation reaches the target viewpoints. Compared with baselines, our method produces higher-quality images at novel extrapolated viewpoints.

*Bertrand Rouet-Leduc,Claudia Hulbert*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 基于深度学习的卫星时间序列异常检测方法，通过训练SATLAS基础模型预测无变化情况下的地表影像，利用预测与观测的差异检测地表变化，在土耳其-叙利亚地震序列中验证了优于传统方法的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 卫星影像地表变化检测对灾害响应和环境监测至关重要，但面临大气噪声、季节变化和传感器伪影等复杂因素的挑战。传统方法难以检测细微变化，需要更高灵敏度的自动化检测方法。

Method: 基于SATLAS基础模型构建修复模型，利用全球分布的训练数据（涵盖不同气候带和土地覆盖类型），训练模型从Sentinel-2时间序列的前期影像预测最后一帧。当应用于发生突然地表变化的区域时，预测与观测之间的差异揭示了传统方法遗漏的异常。

Result: 在2023年土耳其-叙利亚地震序列触发的地表破裂检测中，该方法在Tepehan地区检测到裂谷特征，表现出比时间中值法或Reed-Xiaoli异常检测器更高的灵敏度和特异性。检测阈值比基线方法低约三倍。

Conclusion: 该方法为利用免费多光谱卫星数据实现自动化、全球尺度的地表变化监测提供了可行路径，通过深度学习利用时间序列冗余性，实现了前所未有的异常检测灵敏度。

Abstract: Detecting surface changes from satellite imagery is critical for rapid disaster response and environmental monitoring, yet remains challenging due to the complex interplay between atmospheric noise, seasonal variations, and sensor artifacts. Here we show that deep learning can leverage the temporal redundancy of satellite time series to detect anomalies at unprecedented sensitivity, by learning to predict what the surface should look like in the absence of change. We train an inpainting model built upon the SATLAS foundation model to reconstruct the last frame of a Sentinel-2 time series from preceding acquisitions, using globally distributed training data spanning diverse climate zones and land cover types. When applied to regions affected by sudden surface changes, the discrepancy between prediction and observation reveals anomalies that traditional change detection methods miss. We validate our approach on earthquake-triggered surface ruptures from the 2023 Turkey-Syria earthquake sequence, demonstrating detection of a rift feature in Tepehan with higher sensitivity and specificity than temporal median or Reed-Xiaoli anomaly detectors. Our method reaches detection thresholds approximately three times lower than baseline approaches, providing a path towards automated, global-scale monitoring of surface changes from freely available multi-spectral satellite data.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出GCA-ResUNet，一种结合分组坐标注意力模块的高效医学图像分割框架，在保持CNN效率的同时增强全局表征能力


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: U-Net等CNN方法在建模长距离上下文依赖方面存在局限，尤其在多器官和低对比度区域；Transformer方法虽能解决此问题但计算资源需求高，不利于临床部署

Method: 提出轻量级即插即用的分组坐标注意力(GCA)模块，将通道上下文建模解耦为多组以处理语义异质性，并集成方向感知坐标编码来捕获水平和垂直轴的结构化空间依赖

Result: 在Synapse和ACDC基准测试中分别获得86.11%和92.64%的Dice分数，优于Swin-UNet和TransUNet等代表性方法，在复杂边界的小解剖结构分割上表现一致提升

Conclusion: GCA-ResUNet在分割精度和计算效率之间提供了有利的权衡，为临床部署提供了实用且可扩展的解决方案

Abstract: Accurate segmentation of heterogeneous anatomical structures is pivotal for computer-aided diagnosis and subsequent clinical decision-making. Although U-Net based convolutional neural networks have achieved remarkable progress, their intrinsic locality and largely homogeneous attention formulations often limit the modeling of long-range contextual dependencies, especially in multi-organ scenarios and low-contrast regions. Transformer-based architectures mitigate this issue by leveraging global self-attention, but they usually require higher computational resources and larger training data, which may impede deployment in resource-constrained clinical environments.In this paper, we propose GCA-ResUNet, an efficient medical image segmentation framework equipped with a lightweight and plug-and-play Grouped Coordinate Attention (GCA) module. The proposed GCA decouples channel-wise context modeling into multiple groups to explicitly account for semantic heterogeneity across channels, and integrates direction-aware coordinate encoding to capture structured spatial dependencies along horizontal and vertical axes. This design enhances global representation capability while preserving the efficiency advantages of CNN backbones. Extensive experiments on two widely used benchmarks, Synapse and ACDC, demonstrate that GCA-ResUNet achieves Dice scores of 86.11% and 92.64%, respectively, outperforming a range of representative CNN and Transformer-based methods, including Swin-UNet and TransUNet. In particular, GCA-ResUNet yields consistent improvements in delineating small anatomical structures with complex boundaries. These results indicate that the proposed approach provides a favorable trade-off between segmentation accuracy and computational efficiency, offering a practical and scalable solution for clinical deployment.

TL;DR: GASeg是一个自监督语义分割框架，通过引入可微盒计数模块和拓扑增强策略，利用稳定的拓扑信息来桥接几何与外观特征，解决外观模糊性问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有自监督语义分割方法在面对外观模糊性（如阴影、眩光、局部纹理）时容易失败，因为它们过度依赖不稳定的外观特征。需要利用更稳定的拓扑信息来桥接几何与外观特征。

Method: 提出GASeg框架，包含：1) 可微盒计数模块，从几何流和外观流中量化多尺度拓扑统计；2) 拓扑增强策略，通过形态学操作模拟真实世界模糊性；3) GALoss多目标损失函数，强制跨模态特征对齐。

Conclusion: 通过引入稳定的拓扑信息来桥接几何与外观特征，能够有效解决自监督语义分割中的外观模糊性问题，显著提升分割性能。

Abstract: Self-supervised semantic segmentation methods often fail when faced with appearance ambiguities. We argue that this is due to an over-reliance on unstable, appearance-based features such as shadows, glare, and local textures. We propose \textbf{GASeg}, a novel framework that bridges appearance and geometry by leveraging stable topological information. The core of our method is Differentiable Box-Counting (\textbf{DBC}) module, which quantifies multi-scale topological statistics from two parallel streams: geometric-based features and appearance-based features. To force the model to learn these stable structural representations, we introduce Topological Augmentation (\textbf{TopoAug}), an adversarial strategy that simulates real-world ambiguities by applying morphological operators to the input images. A multi-objective loss, \textbf{GALoss}, then explicitly enforces cross-modal alignment between geometric-based and appearance-based features. Extensive experiments demonstrate that GASeg achieves state-of-the-art performance on four benchmarks, including COCO-Stuff, Cityscapes, and PASCAL, validating our approach of bridging geometry and appearance via topological information.

Motivation: 在太空交会对接操作中，从图像序列恢复未知航天器的3D结构面临动态光照挑战。传统3D高斯溅射需要静态场景假设，而太空图像的光照条件变化剧烈，影响模型的光度精度，进而影响下游的相机位姿估计任务。

Abstract: This work presents a novel pipeline to recover the 3D structure of an unknown target spacecraft from a sequence of images captured during Rendezvous and Proximity Operations (RPO) in space. The target's geometry and appearance are represented as a 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) model. However, learning 3DGS requires static scenes, an assumption in contrast to dynamic lighting conditions encountered in spaceborne imagery. The trained 3DGS model can also be used for camera pose estimation through photometric optimization. Therefore, in addition to recovering a geometrically accurate 3DGS model, the photometric accuracy of the rendered images is imperative to downstream pose estimation tasks during the RPO process. This work proposes to incorporate the prior knowledge of the Sun's position, estimated and maintained by the servicer spacecraft, into the training pipeline for improved photometric quality of 3DGS rasterization. Experimental studies demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed solution, as 3DGS models trained on a sequence of images learn to adapt to rapidly changing illumination conditions in space and reflect global shadowing and self-occlusion.

Motivation: 现有流式扩散编辑方法在源图像和目标图像分布间直接转换时，潜在轨迹存在累积速度误差，导致语义不一致和结构保真度损失。需要解决这些误差以提升编辑质量。

Abstract: Recent methods in flow-based diffusion editing have enabled direct transformations between source and target image distribution without explicit inversion. However, the latent trajectories in these methods often exhibit accumulated velocity errors, leading to semantic inconsistency and loss of structural fidelity. We propose Conditioned Velocity Correction (CVC), a principled framework that reformulates flow-based editing as a distribution transformation problem driven by a known source prior. CVC rethinks the role of velocity in inter-distribution transformation by introducing a dual-perspective velocity conversion mechanism. This mechanism explicitly decomposes the latent evolution into two components: a structure-preserving branch that remains consistent with the source trajectory, and a semantically-guided branch that drives a controlled deviation toward the target distribution. The conditional velocity field exhibits an absolute velocity error relative to the true underlying distribution trajectory, which inherently introduces potential instability and trajectory drift in the latent space. To address this quantifiable deviation and maintain fidelity to the true flow, we apply a posterior-consistent update to the resulting conditional velocity field. This update is derived from Empirical Bayes Inference and Tweedie correction, which ensures a mathematically grounded error compensation over time. Our method yields stable and interpretable latent dynamics, achieving faithful reconstruction alongside smooth local semantic conversion. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that CVC consistently achieves superior fidelity, better semantic alignment, and more reliable editing behavior across diverse tasks.

TL;DR: FitControler是一个可学习的插件，能够集成到现有的虚拟试穿模型中，实现服装合身度的定制化控制，解决了传统VTON方法忽视服装合身度这一关键风格因素的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统虚拟试穿方法主要关注服装细节的忠实渲染，但忽视了塑造整体风格的关键因素——服装合身度。合身度定义了服装与穿着者身体的贴合方式，是时尚设计的基本要素，对整体风格有重要影响。

Method: 提出FitControler插件，包含两个核心组件：1) 合身度感知布局生成器，基于精心处理的服装无关表示重新绘制身体-服装布局；2) 多尺度合身度注入器，将布局线索传递给VTON模型实现布局驱动的虚拟试穿。同时构建了包含13,000个不同合身度身体-服装对的Fit4Men数据集。

Abstract: Realistic virtual try-on (VTON) concerns not only faithful rendering of garment details but also coordination of the style. Prior art typically pursues the former, but neglects a key factor that shapes the holistic style -- garment fit. Garment fit delineates how a garment aligns with the body of a wearer and is a fundamental element in fashion design. In this work, we introduce fit-aware VTON and present FitControler, a learnable plug-in that can seamlessly integrate into modern VTON models to enable customized fit control. To achieve this, we highlight two challenges: i) how to delineate layouts of different fits and ii) how to render the garment that matches the layout. FitControler first features a fit-aware layout generator to redraw the body-garment layout conditioned on a set of delicately processed garment-agnostic representations, and a multi-scale fit injector is then used to deliver layout cues to enable layout-driven VTON. In particular, we build a fit-aware VTON dataset termed Fit4Men, including 13,000 body-garment pairs of different fits, covering both tops and bottoms, and featuring varying camera distances and body poses. Two fit consistency metrics are also introduced to assess the fitness of generations. Extensive experiments show that FitControler can work with various VTON models and achieve accurate fit control. Code and data will be released.

TL;DR: 提出结构引导的2D高斯泼溅分配方法，通过结构感知的初始化、自适应比特量化以及几何一致性正则化，显著提升2DGS的表示能力和率失真性能，同时保持毫秒级解码速度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有2DGS方法在分配表示容量和参数精度时未充分考虑图像结构，导致在低比特率下的率失真效率受限。需要一种能够显式耦合图像结构与表示能力/量化精度的方法，同时保持原生解码速度。

Method: 1. 结构引导初始化：基于自然图像的空间结构先验分配2D高斯分布，获得局部化且语义有意义的分布；2. 自适应比特量化：在量化感知微调中，对协方差参数进行自适应比特宽度量化，为复杂区域的小尺度高斯分配更高精度；3. 几何一致性正则化：对齐高斯方向与局部梯度方向以更好保留结构细节。

Result: 方法显著提升了2DGS的表示能力和RD性能，同时保持超过1000 FPS的解码速度。相比基线GSImage，在Kodak数据集上BD-rate降低43.44%，在DIV2K数据集上降低29.91%。

Conclusion: 提出的结构引导分配原则通过显式耦合图像结构与表示容量/量化精度，有效提升了2D高斯泼溅的率失真效率，为紧凑图像表示提供了新思路，同时保持了实时解码能力。

Abstract: Recent advances in 2D Gaussian Splatting (2DGS) have demonstrated its potential as a compact image representation with millisecond-level decoding. However, existing 2DGS-based pipelines allocate representation capacity and parameter precision largely oblivious to image structure, limiting their rate-distortion (RD) efficiency at low bitrates. To address this, we propose a structure-guided allocation principle for 2DGS, which explicitly couples image structure with both representation capacity and quantization precision, while preserving native decoding speed. First, we introduce a structure-guided initialization that assigns 2D Gaussians according to spatial structural priors inherent in natural images, yielding a localized and semantically meaningful distribution. Second, during quantization-aware fine-tuning, we propose adaptive bitwidth quantization of covariance parameters, which grants higher precision to small-scale Gaussians in complex regions and lower precision elsewhere, enabling RD-aware optimization, thereby reducing redundancy without degrading edge quality. Third, we impose a geometry-consistent regularization that aligns Gaussian orientations with local gradient directions to better preserve structural details. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach substantially improves both the representational power and the RD performance of 2DGS while maintaining over 1000 FPS decoding. Compared with the baseline GSImage, we reduce BD-rate by 43.44% on Kodak and 29.91% on DIV2K.

Abstract: Large vision-language models (VLMs) exhibit strong performance across various tasks. However, these VLMs encounter significant challenges when applied to the remote sensing domain due to the inherent differences between remote sensing images and natural images. Existing remote sensing VLMs often fail to extract fine-grained visual features and suffer from visual forgetting during deep language processing. To address this, we introduce MF-RSVLM, a Multi-Feature Fusion Remote Sensing Vision--Language Model that effectively extracts and fuses visual features for RS understanding. MF-RSVLM learns multi-scale visual representations and combines global context with local details, improving the capture of small and complex structures in RS scenes. A recurrent visual feature injection scheme ensures the language model remains grounded in visual evidence and reduces visual forgetting during generation. Extensive experiments on diverse RS benchmarks show that MF-RSVLM achieves state-of-the-art or highly competitive performance across remote sensing classification, image captioning, and VQA tasks.

Motivation: 现有文本引导分割方法通常采用单次前向传播的方式预测像素提示来驱动外部分割器，当初始定位错误时缺乏验证、重新聚焦和细化的能力。需要一种能够通过多轮交互进行迭代优化的方法。

Conclusion: RSAgent通过智能体式的多轮推理-行动交互，有效解决了传统单次前向分割方法的局限性，在文本引导分割任务中实现了显著的性能提升和更好的迭代优化能力。

Abstract: Text-guided object segmentation requires both cross-modal reasoning and pixel grounding abilities. Most recent methods treat text-guided segmentation as one-shot grounding, where the model predicts pixel prompts in a single forward pass to drive an external segmentor, which limits verification, refocusing and refinement when initial localization is wrong. To address this limitation, we propose RSAgent, an agentic Multimodal Large Language Model (MLLM) which interleaves reasoning and action for segmentation via multi-turn tool invocations. RSAgent queries a segmentation toolbox, observes visual feedback, and revises its spatial hypothesis using historical observations to re-localize targets and iteratively refine masks. We further build a data pipeline to synthesize multi-turn reasoning segmentation trajectories, and train RSAgent with a two-stage framework: cold-start supervised fine-tuning followed by agentic reinforcement learning with fine-grained, task-specific rewards. Extensive experiments show that RSAgent achieves a zero-shot performance of 66.5% gIoU on ReasonSeg test, improving over Seg-Zero-7B by 9%, and reaches 81.5% cIoU on RefCOCOg, demonstrating state-of-the-art performance on both in-domain and out-of-domain benchmarks.

Abstract: Image denoising is an important problem in low-level vision and serves as a critical module for many image recovery tasks. Anisotropic diffusion is a wide family of image denoising approaches with promising performance. However, traditional anisotropic diffusion approaches use explicit diffusion operators which are not well adapted to complex image structures. As a result, their performance is limited compared to recent learning-based approaches. In this work, we describe a trainable anisotropic diffusion framework based on reinforcement learning. By modeling the denoising process as a series of naive diffusion actions with order learned by deep Q-learning, we propose an effective diffusion-based image denoiser. The diffusion actions selected by deep Q-learning at different iterations indeed composite a stochastic anisotropic diffusion process with strong adaptivity to different image structures, which enjoys improvement over the traditional ones. The proposed denoiser is applied to removing three types of often-seen noise. The experiments show that it outperforms existing diffusion-based methods and competes with the representative deep CNN-based methods.

Conclusion: NIRNL通过细粒度实例划分和定制优化策略，有效利用所有可用数据同时减轻错误传播，解决了噪声标签下的跨模态检索问题

Abstract: In recent years, Cross-Modal Retrieval (CMR) has made significant progress in the field of multi-modal analysis. However, since it is time-consuming and labor-intensive to collect large-scale and well-annotated data, the annotation of multi-modal data inevitably contains some noise. This will degrade the retrieval performance of the model. To tackle the problem, numerous robust CMR methods have been developed, including robust learning paradigms, label calibration strategies, and instance selection mechanisms. Unfortunately, they often fail to simultaneously satisfy model performance ceilings, calibration reliability, and data utilization rate. To overcome the limitations, we propose a novel robust cross-modal learning framework, namely Neighbor-aware Instance Refining with Noisy Labels (NIRNL). Specifically, we first propose Cross-modal Margin Preserving (CMP) to adjust the relative distance between positive and negative pairs, thereby enhancing the discrimination between sample pairs. Then, we propose Neighbor-aware Instance Refining (NIR) to identify pure subset, hard subset, and noisy subset through cross-modal neighborhood consensus. Afterward, we construct different tailored optimization strategies for this fine-grained partitioning, thereby maximizing the utilization of all available data while mitigating error propagation. Extensive experiments on three benchmark datasets demonstrate that NIRNL achieves state-of-the-art performance, exhibiting remarkable robustness, especially under high noise rates.

Conclusion: 提出的平衡层次对比损失与解耦学习策略有效解决了细粒度遥感检测中的层次标签不平衡和语义关系干扰定位问题，在DETR框架中实现了更好的性能。

Abstract: Fine-grained remote sensing datasets often use hierarchical label structures to differentiate objects in a coarse-to-fine manner, with each object annotated across multiple levels. However, embedding this semantic hierarchy into the representation learning space to improve fine-grained detection performance remains challenging. Previous studies have applied supervised contrastive learning at different hierarchical levels to group objects under the same parent class while distinguishing sibling subcategories. Nevertheless, they overlook two critical issues: (1) imbalanced data distribution across the label hierarchy causes high-frequency classes to dominate the learning process, and (2) learning semantic relationships among categories interferes with class-agnostic localization. To address these issues, we propose a balanced hierarchical contrastive loss combined with a decoupled learning strategy within the detection transformer (DETR) framework. The proposed loss introduces learnable class prototypes and equilibrates gradients contributed by different classes at each hierarchical level, ensuring that each hierarchical class contributes equally to the loss computation in every mini-batch. The decoupled strategy separates DETR's object queries into classification and localization sets, enabling task-specific feature extraction and optimization. Experiments on three fine-grained datasets with hierarchical annotations demonstrate that our method outperforms state-of-the-art approaches.

Motivation: 扩散变换器(DiT)模型在视频和图像生成任务中因注意力机制导致极高的计算成本，限制了实际应用。随着硬件发展，除了GPU外，ASIC等设备也越来越多用于模型推理。现有稀疏注意力方法存在两个关键限制：稀疏模式预测的开销和缺乏硬件通用性。

Abstract: In video and image generation tasks, Diffusion Transformer (DiT) models incur extremely high computational costs due to attention mechanisms, which limits their practical applications. Furthermore, with hardware advancements, a wide range of devices besides graphics processing unit (GPU), such as application-specific integrated circuit (ASIC), have been increasingly adopted for model inference. Sparse attention, which leverages the inherent sparsity of attention by skipping computations for insignificant tokens, is an effective approach to mitigate computational costs. However, existing sparse attention methods have two critical limitations: the overhead of sparse pattern prediction and the lack of hardware generality, as most of these methods are designed for GPU. To address these challenges, this study proposes RainFusion2.0, which aims to develop an online adaptive, hardware-efficient, and low-overhead sparse attention mechanism to accelerate both video and image generative models, with robust performance across diverse hardware platforms. Key technical insights include: (1) leveraging block-wise mean values as representative tokens for sparse mask prediction; (2) implementing spatiotemporal-aware token permutation; and (3) introducing a first-frame sink mechanism specifically designed for video generation scenarios. Experimental results demonstrate that RainFusion2.0 can achieve 80% sparsity while achieving an end-to-end speedup of 1.5~1.8x without compromising video quality. Moreover, RainFusion2.0 demonstrates effectiveness across various generative models and validates its generalization across diverse hardware platforms.

Abstract: Recent video-language models have shown great potential for video understanding, but still struggle with accurate temporal grounding for event-level perception. We observe that two main factors in video understanding (i.e., temporal grounding and textual response) form a logical hierarchy: accurate temporal evidence grounding lays the foundation for reliable textual response. However, existing works typically handle these two tasks in a coupled manner without a clear logical structure, leading to sub-optimal objectives. We address this from a factorized learning perspective. We first propose D$^2$VLM, a framework that decouples the learning of these two tasks while also emphasizing their inherent dependency. We adopt a "grounding then answering with evidence referencing" paradigm and introduce evidence tokens for evidence grounding, which emphasize event-level visual semantic capture beyond the focus on timestamp representation in existing works. To further facilitate the learning of these two tasks, we introduce a novel factorized preference optimization (FPO) algorithm. Unlike standard preference optimization, FPO explicitly incorporates probabilistic temporal grounding modeling into the optimization objective, enabling preference learning for both temporal grounding and textual response. We also construct a synthetic dataset to address the lack of suitable datasets for factorized preference learning with explicit temporal grounding. Experiments on various tasks demonstrate the clear advantage of our approach. Our source code is available at https://github.com/nusnlp/d2vlm.

TL;DR: 该论文提出Latent Motion Reasoning (LMR)框架，通过两阶段"思考-行动"决策过程解决文本到动作生成中的语义-运动学阻抗不匹配问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前文本到动作生成方法将问题视为直接翻译，面临语义-运动学阻抗不匹配的根本瓶颈：难以将语义密集的离散语言意图直接映射到运动学密集的高频运动数据。需要从系统1的直接映射转向系统2的潜在推理架构。

Method: 提出Latent Motion Reasoning (LMR)框架，采用两阶段"思考-行动"决策过程：1) 思考阶段：在压缩的语义丰富推理潜在空间中规划全局拓扑；2) 行动阶段：在高频执行潜在空间中实例化具体帧。核心是新颖的双粒度分词器，将运动解耦为两个不同的流形。

Result: 在T2M-GPT（离散）和MotionStreamer（连续）两个代表性基线上实现LMR，实验显示在语义对齐和物理合理性方面均取得非平凡改进，验证了运动规划的最佳基底是学习的运动对齐概念空间而非自然语言。

Conclusion: 通过引入潜在系统2推理架构，将文本到动作生成重新定义为两阶段决策过程，有效弥合了语言与物理之间的不可言说性鸿沟，证明了运动对齐概念空间作为运动规划基底的优越性。

Abstract: Current state-of-the-art paradigms predominantly treat Text-to-Motion (T2M) generation as a direct translation problem, mapping symbolic language directly to continuous poses. While effective for simple actions, this System 1 approach faces a fundamental theoretical bottleneck we identify as the Semantic-Kinematic Impedance Mismatch: the inherent difficulty of grounding semantically dense, discrete linguistic intent into kinematically dense, high-frequency motion data in a single shot. In this paper, we argue that the solution lies in an architectural shift towards Latent System 2 Reasoning. Drawing inspiration from Hierarchical Motor Control in cognitive science, we propose Latent Motion Reasoning (LMR) that reformulates generation as a two-stage Think-then-Act decision process. Central to LMR is a novel Dual-Granularity Tokenizer that disentangles motion into two distinct manifolds: a compressed, semantically rich Reasoning Latent for planning global topology, and a high-frequency Execution Latent for preserving physical fidelity. By forcing the model to autoregressively reason (plan the coarse trajectory) before it moves (instantiates the frames), we effectively bridge the ineffability gap between language and physics. We demonstrate LMR's versatility by implementing it for two representative baselines: T2M-GPT (discrete) and MotionStreamer (continuous). Extensive experiments show that LMR yields non-trivial improvements in both semantic alignment and physical plausibility, validating that the optimal substrate for motion planning is not natural language, but a learned, motion-aligned concept space.

Abstract: Monocular Depth Estimation (MDE) serves as a core perception module in autonomous driving systems, but it remains highly susceptible to adversarial attacks. Errors in depth estimation may propagate through downstream decision making and influence overall traffic safety. Existing physical attacks primarily rely on texture-based patches, which impose strict placement constraints and exhibit limited realism, thereby reducing their effectiveness in complex driving environments. To overcome these limitations, this work introduces a training-free generative adversarial attack framework that generates naturalistic, scene-consistent adversarial objects via a diffusion-based conditional generation process. The framework incorporates a Salient Region Selection module that identifies regions most influential to MDE and a Jacobian Vector Product Guidance mechanism that steers adversarial gradients toward update directions supported by the pre-trained diffusion model. This formulation enables the generation of physically plausible adversarial objects capable of inducing substantial adversarial depth shifts. Extensive digital and physical experiments demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms existing attacks in effectiveness, stealthiness, and physical deployability, underscoring its strong practical implications for autonomous driving safety assessment.

TL;DR: GeoBench是一个用于评估视觉语言模型几何推理能力的层次化基准，包含四个推理级别，通过六个形式化验证任务系统评估从属性提取到逻辑错误纠正的能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前几何推理评估存在三个主要问题：1) 基于教科书的基准存在测试数据污染风险；2) 过度强调最终答案而非推理过程；3) 诊断粒度不足。需要更全面的评估框架来准确衡量视觉语言模型的几何问题解决能力。

Method: 提出GeoBench基准，包含四个层次化推理级别：视觉感知、目标导向规划、严格定理应用、自反思回溯。通过TrustGeoGen生成六个形式化验证任务，系统评估从低级属性提取到高级逻辑错误纠正的能力。

Result: 实验显示：1) 推理模型如OpenAI-o3优于通用MLLMs；2) 随着任务复杂度增加，性能显著下降；3) 子目标分解和无关前提过滤对最终准确性有重要影响；4) 思维链提示在某些任务中意外降低性能。

Conclusion: GeoBench建立了全面的几何推理评估基准，为开发几何问题解决系统提供了可操作的指导方针，揭示了当前模型在复杂几何推理任务中的局限性。

Abstract: Geometric problem solving constitutes a critical branch of mathematical reasoning, requiring precise analysis of shapes and spatial relationships. Current evaluations of geometric reasoning in vision-language models (VLMs) face limitations, including the risk of test data contamination from textbook-based benchmarks, overemphasis on final answers over reasoning processes, and insufficient diagnostic granularity. To address these issues, we present GeoBench, a hierarchical benchmark featuring four reasoning levels in geometric problem-solving: Visual Perception, Goal-Oriented Planning, Rigorous Theorem Application, and Self-Reflective Backtracking. Through six formally verified tasks generated via TrustGeoGen, we systematically assess capabilities ranging from attribute extraction to logical error correction. Experiments reveal that while reasoning models like OpenAI-o3 outperform general MLLMs, performance declines significantly with increasing task complexity. Key findings demonstrate that sub-goal decomposition and irrelevant premise filtering critically influence final problem-solving accuracy, whereas Chain-of-Thought prompting unexpectedly degrades performance in some tasks. These findings establish GeoBench as a comprehensive benchmark while offering actionable guidelines for developing geometric problem-solving systems.

TL;DR: 提出D²-Align方法解决文本到图像扩散模型在人类反馈强化学习中的偏好模式崩溃问题，通过方向性解耦奖励信号来保持生成多样性


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于人类反馈强化学习的文本到图像扩散模型虽然能在自动化奖励指标上获得高分，但往往导致偏好模式崩溃——模型收敛到狭窄的高分输出模式（如单一风格或普遍过曝），严重损害生成多样性

Method: 提出方向性解耦对齐（D²-Align）框架：1）在奖励模型的嵌入空间中学习方向性校正（保持模型冻结）；2）在优化过程中将校正应用于奖励信号，防止模型崩溃到特定模式；同时提出DivGenBench基准来量化偏好模式崩溃程度

Result: D²-Align在质量和多样性指标上均表现出色，实现了与人类偏好的更好对齐，同时避免了偏好模式崩溃问题

Conclusion: 偏好模式崩溃是文本到图像扩散模型对齐中的重要问题，D²-Align通过方向性校正奖励信号有效缓解了这一问题，在保持生成多样性的同时实现了更好的人类偏好对齐

Abstract: Recent studies have demonstrated significant progress in aligning text-to-image diffusion models with human preference via Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback. However, while existing methods achieve high scores on automated reward metrics, they often lead to Preference Mode Collapse (PMC)-a specific form of reward hacking where models converge on narrow, high-scoring outputs (e.g., images with monolithic styles or pervasive overexposure), severely degrading generative diversity. In this work, we introduce and quantify this phenomenon, proposing DivGenBench, a novel benchmark designed to measure the extent of PMC. We posit that this collapse is driven by over-optimization along the reward model's inherent biases. Building on this analysis, we propose Directional Decoupling Alignment (D$^2$-Align), a novel framework that mitigates PMC by directionally correcting the reward signal. Specifically, our method first learns a directional correction within the reward model's embedding space while keeping the model frozen. This correction is then applied to the reward signal during the optimization process, preventing the model from collapsing into specific modes and thereby maintaining diversity. Our comprehensive evaluation, combining qualitative analysis with quantitative metrics for both quality and diversity, reveals that D$^2$-Align achieves superior alignment with human preference.

TL;DR: 提出了首个大规模工业多模态缺陷数据集IMDD-1M，包含100万对齐的图像-文本对，并基于此训练了面向工业场景的扩散式视觉语言基础模型，通过轻量微调即可高效适应特定领域。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 工业制造和质量检测领域缺乏大规模、高质量的多模态数据集，限制了多模态学习在该领域的应用。现有方法通常需要大量任务特定数据，缺乏通用性和可扩展性。

Method: 1. 构建IMDD-1M数据集：包含100万张高分辨率真实缺陷图像，涵盖60+材料类别和400+缺陷类型，每张图像配有专家验证的细粒度文本描述（缺陷位置、严重程度、上下文属性）。2. 基于该数据集从头训练扩散式视觉语言基础模型，专门针对工业场景设计。3. 通过轻量微调将基础模型高效适应到特定领域。

Abstract: We present IMDD-1M, the first large-scale Industrial Multimodal Defect Dataset comprising 1,000,000 aligned image-text pairs, designed to advance multimodal learning for manufacturing and quality inspection. IMDD-1M contains high-resolution real-world defects spanning over 60 material categories and more than 400 defect types, each accompanied by expert-verified annotations and fine-grained textual descriptions detailing defect location, severity, and contextual attributes. This dataset enables a wide spectrum of applications, including classification, segmentation, retrieval, captioning, and generative modeling. Building upon IMDD-1M, we train a diffusion-based vision-language foundation model from scratch, specifically tailored for industrial scenarios. The model serves as a generalizable foundation that can be efficiently adapted to specialized domains through lightweight fine-tuning. With less than 5% of the task-specific data required by dedicated expert models, it achieves comparable performance, highlighting the potential of data-efficient foundation model adaptation for industrial inspection and generation, paving the way for scalable, domain-adaptive, and knowledge-grounded manufacturing intelligence.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前多模态大语言模型（MLLMs）在多模态推理方面取得显著进展，但其推理过程仍以文本为中心，导致在复杂长视野、视觉中心任务中表现不佳。

Method: 建立生成式多模态推理新范式，提出DiffThinker——基于扩散的推理框架，将多模态推理重新定义为原生图像到图像生成任务。

Result: 在四个领域（顺序规划、组合优化、约束满足、空间配置）的广泛实验表明，DiffThinker显著优于领先的闭源模型（GPT-5 +314.2%，Gemini-3-Flash +111.6%）和微调的Qwen3-VL-32B基线（+39.0%）。

Conclusion: 生成式多模态推理是视觉中心推理的有前景方法，DiffThinker框架展示了效率、可控性、原生并行性和协作性四大核心特性。

Abstract: While recent Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have attained significant strides in multimodal reasoning, their reasoning processes remain predominantly text-centric, leading to suboptimal performance in complex long-horizon, vision-centric tasks. In this paper, we establish a novel Generative Multimodal Reasoning paradigm and introduce DiffThinker, a diffusion-based reasoning framework. Conceptually, DiffThinker reformulates multimodal reasoning as a native generative image-to-image task, achieving superior logical consistency and spatial precision in vision-centric tasks. We perform a systematic comparison between DiffThinker and MLLMs, providing the first in-depth investigation into the intrinsic characteristics of this paradigm, revealing four core properties: efficiency, controllability, native parallelism, and collaboration. Extensive experiments across four domains (sequential planning, combinatorial optimization, constraint satisfaction, and spatial configuration) demonstrate that DiffThinker significantly outperforms leading closed source models including GPT-5 (+314.2\%) and Gemini-3-Flash (+111.6\%), as well as the fine-tuned Qwen3-VL-32B baseline (+39.0\%), highlighting generative multimodal reasoning as a promising approach for vision-centric reasoning.

*Yu-Tang Chang,Pin-Wei Chen,Shih-Fang Chen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出Deep Global Clustering (DGC)框架，用于内存高效的高光谱图像分割，通过局部补丁学习全局聚类结构，无需预训练，在消费级硬件上30分钟内完成训练。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 高光谱图像分析面临数据量大、内存不足的计算瓶颈，现有基础模型在遥感数据集上预训练后难以迁移到近距离农业监测等特定领域应用，因为光谱特征、空间尺度和语义目标存在根本差异。

Method: DGC框架在重叠的小补丁上操作，通过一致性约束学习全局聚类结构，保持恒定内存使用，无需预训练，实现内存高效的高光谱图像分割。

Result: 在叶片病害数据集上，DGC实现背景-组织分离（平均IoU 0.925），通过可导航的语义粒度展示无监督病害检测能力，但存在优化不稳定问题，源于多目标损失平衡导致的聚类过度合并。

Conclusion: DGC作为概念框架具有设计价值，但稳定实现需要动态损失平衡的原则性方法，该工作为后续研究提供了智力支架。

Abstract: Hyperspectral imaging (HSI) analysis faces computational bottlenecks due to massive data volumes that exceed available memory. While foundation models pre-trained on large remote sensing datasets show promise, their learned representations often fail to transfer to domain-specific applications like close-range agricultural monitoring where spectral signatures, spatial scales, and semantic targets differ fundamentally. This report presents Deep Global Clustering (DGC), a conceptual framework for memory-efficient HSI segmentation that learns global clustering structure from local patch observations without pre-training. DGC operates on small patches with overlapping regions to enforce consistency, enabling training in under 30 minutes on consumer hardware while maintaining constant memory usage. On a leaf disease dataset, DGC achieves background-tissue separation (mean IoU 0.925) and demonstrates unsupervised disease detection through navigable semantic granularity. However, the framework suffers from optimization instability rooted in multi-objective loss balancing: meaningful representations emerge rapidly but degrade due to cluster over-merging in feature space. We position this work as intellectual scaffolding - the design philosophy has merit, but stable implementation requires principled approaches to dynamic loss balancing.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出内部引导（IG）策略，通过在训练过程中引入中间层辅助监督，在采样过程中外推中间层和深层输出来提升扩散模型生成质量，显著优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 扩散模型难以覆盖低概率区域，标准CFG会导致样本过度简化或失真，而基于退化版本的引导方法需要精心设计的退化策略、额外训练和采样步骤。需要一种简单有效的策略来提升生成质量。

Method: 提出内部引导（IG）策略：1）训练阶段：在中间层引入辅助监督；2）采样阶段：外推中间层和深层输出以获得生成结果。该方法简单且无需额外训练或复杂采样步骤。

Result: 在ImageNet 256x256上，SiT-XL/2+IG在80和800轮分别达到FID=5.31和1.75；LightningDiT-XL/1+IG达到FID=1.34；结合CFG后达到当前最优FID=1.19，显著优于所有基线方法。

Conclusion: 内部引导（IG）是一种简单有效的策略，通过在训练中引入中间层监督并在采样中外推输出，显著提升了扩散模型的训练效率和生成质量，在多个基准上实现了最先进性能。

Abstract: The diffusion model presents a powerful ability to capture the entire (conditional) data distribution. However, due to the lack of sufficient training and data to learn to cover low-probability areas, the model will be penalized for failing to generate high-quality images corresponding to these areas. To achieve better generation quality, guidance strategies such as classifier free guidance (CFG) can guide the samples to the high-probability areas during the sampling stage. However, the standard CFG often leads to over-simplified or distorted samples. On the other hand, the alternative line of guiding diffusion model with its bad version is limited by carefully designed degradation strategies, extra training and additional sampling steps. In this paper, we proposed a simple yet effective strategy Internal Guidance (IG), which introduces an auxiliary supervision on the intermediate layer during training process and extrapolates the intermediate and deep layer's outputs to obtain generative results during sampling process. This simple strategy yields significant improvements in both training efficiency and generation quality on various baselines. On ImageNet 256x256, SiT-XL/2+IG achieves FID=5.31 and FID=1.75 at 80 and 800 epochs. More impressively, LightningDiT-XL/1+IG achieves FID=1.34 which achieves a large margin between all of these methods. Combined with CFG, LightningDiT-XL/1+IG achieves the current state-of-the-art FID of 1.19.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CorGi是一种无需训练、基于贡献度引导的块级间隔缓存框架，用于加速扩散Transformer（DiT）推理，通过选择性重用DiT中transformer块的输出来减少去噪步骤间的冗余计算。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: DiT在视觉生成中表现出色，但其迭代去噪过程结合大模型容量导致推理成本高昂。现有研究表明DiT模型的迭代去噪过程在步骤间存在大量冗余计算，需要有效减少这些冗余。

Method: 提出CorGi框架：1）基于贡献度评估识别低贡献transformer块；2）在间隔内缓存这些块的输出并在后续步骤中重用；3）针对文本到图像任务提出CorGi+，利用跨注意力图识别显著token并应用部分注意力更新以保护重要对象细节。

Result: 在最先进的DiT模型上评估，CorGi和CorGi+平均实现高达2.0倍的加速，同时保持高生成质量。

Conclusion: CorGi是一种有效的训练免费DiT推理加速框架，通过选择性重用transformer块输出来减少冗余计算，在保持生成质量的同时显著提升推理速度。

Abstract: Diffusion transformer (DiT) achieves remarkable performance in visual generation, but its iterative denoising process combined with larger capacity leads to a high inference cost. Recent works have demonstrated that the iterative denoising process of DiT models involves substantial redundant computation across steps. To effectively reduce the redundant computation in DiT, we propose CorGi (Contribution-Guided Block-Wise Interval Caching), training-free DiT inference acceleration framework that selectively reuses the outputs of transformer blocks in DiT across denoising steps. CorGi caches low-contribution blocks and reuses them in later steps within each interval to reduce redundant computation while preserving generation quality. For text-to-image tasks, we further propose CorGi+, which leverages per-block cross-attention maps to identify salient tokens and applies partial attention updates to protect important object details. Evaluation on the state-of-the-art DiT models demonstrates that CorGi and CorGi+ achieve up to 2.0x speedup on average, while preserving high generation quality.

*Ziquan Liu,Zhewei Zhu,Xuyang Shi*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ARM是一个轻量级可学习模块，通过语义引导的交叉注意力和自注意力机制，自适应融合CLIP的层次特征，实现"训练一次，随处使用"的范式，显著提升训练无关开放词汇语义分割性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有训练无关方法要么依赖昂贵的外部基础模型（如SAM、DINO），要么对CLIP内部特征使用静态手工启发式方法，导致计算成本高或性能次优。CLIP的图像级表示缺乏精确的像素级细节，限制了开放词汇语义分割的发展。

Method: 提出注意力精炼模块（ARM），包含语义引导的交叉注意力块和自注意力块。使用鲁棒的深层特征（K，V）选择和精炼细节丰富的浅层特征（Q），实现层次特征的自适应融合。采用"训练一次，随处使用"范式，在通用数据集（如COCO-Stuff）上训练后，可作为通用即插即用后处理器。

Result: 在多个基准测试中，ARM能持续提升基线性能，且推理开销可忽略不计。实验证明其作为训练无关开放词汇语义分割的高效有效范式。

Conclusion: ARM通过解锁和精炼CLIP内部潜力，解决了现有训练无关方法的局限性，建立了高效有效的训练无关开放词汇语义分割新范式。

Abstract: Open-vocabulary semantic segmentation (OVSS) is fundamentally hampered by the coarse, image-level representations of CLIP, which lack precise pixel-level details. Existing training-free methods attempt to resolve this by either importing priors from costly external foundation models (e.g., SAM, DINO) or by applying static, hand-crafted heuristics to CLIP's internal features. These approaches are either computationally expensive or sub-optimal. We propose the Attention Refinement Module (ARM), a lightweight, learnable module that effectively unlocks and refines CLIP's internal potential. Unlike static-fusion methods, ARM learns to adaptively fuse hierarchical features. It employs a semantically-guided cross-attention block, using robust deep features (K, V) to select and refine detail-rich shallow features (Q), followed by a self-attention block. The key innovation lies in a ``train once, use anywhere" paradigm. Trained once on a general-purpose dataset (e.g., COCO-Stuff), ARM acts as a universal plug-and-play post-processor for diverse training-free frameworks. Extensive experiments show that ARM consistently boosts baseline performance on multiple benchmarks with negligible inference overhead, establishing an efficient and effective paradigm for training-free OVSS.

Motivation: 基于视觉的自动驾驶系统需要多样化和可扩展的训练数据，现有视频对象编辑方法在保持高视觉保真度和时间一致性方面存在困难，需要一种能够同时满足这两个要求的解决方案。

Method: 1. 基于文本到视频扩散先验确保时间一致性；2. 将预训练2D编码器的时序无关潜在特征注入3D解码器以恢复细节；3. 引入两阶段数据对齐策略：粗粒度3D对齐和细粒度2D精炼，解决场景对象与插入资产之间的分布不匹配问题。

Result: Mirage在多种编辑场景中实现了高真实感和时间一致性，能够泛化到其他视频到视频转换任务，为未来研究提供了可靠基线。

Conclusion: Mirage通过创新的特征注入和对齐策略，成功解决了驾驶场景资产编辑中的视觉保真度和时间一致性问题，为自动驾驶数据增强提供了有效工具。

Abstract: Vision-centric autonomous driving systems rely on diverse and scalable training data to achieve robust performance. While video object editing offers a promising path for data augmentation, existing methods often struggle to maintain both high visual fidelity and temporal coherence. In this work, we propose \textbf{Mirage}, a one-step video diffusion model for photorealistic and coherent asset editing in driving scenes. Mirage builds upon a text-to-video diffusion prior to ensure temporal consistency across frames. However, 3D causal variational autoencoders often suffer from degraded spatial fidelity due to compression, and directly passing 3D encoder features to decoder layers breaks temporal causality. To address this, we inject temporally agnostic latents from a pretrained 2D encoder into the 3D decoder to restore detail while preserving causal structures. Furthermore, because scene objects and inserted assets are optimized under different objectives, their Gaussians exhibit a distribution mismatch that leads to pose misalignment. To mitigate this, we introduce a two-stage data alignment strategy combining coarse 3D alignment and fine 2D refinement, thereby improving alignment and providing cleaner supervision. Extensive experiments demonstrate that Mirage achieves high realism and temporal consistency across diverse editing scenarios. Beyond asset editing, Mirage can also generalize to other video-to-video translation tasks, serving as a reliable baseline for future research.

Conclusion: MambaSeg展示了高效、可扩展且鲁棒的多模态感知的潜力，通过并行Mamba编码器和双维度交互模块有效解决了RGB-事件融合中的计算效率和时空动态建模问题。

Abstract: Semantic segmentation is a fundamental task in computer vision with wide-ranging applications, including autonomous driving and robotics. While RGB-based methods have achieved strong performance with CNNs and Transformers, their effectiveness degrades under fast motion, low-light, or high dynamic range conditions due to limitations of frame cameras. Event cameras offer complementary advantages such as high temporal resolution and low latency, yet lack color and texture, making them insufficient on their own. To address this, recent research has explored multimodal fusion of RGB and event data; however, many existing approaches are computationally expensive and focus primarily on spatial fusion, neglecting the temporal dynamics inherent in event streams. In this work, we propose MambaSeg, a novel dual-branch semantic segmentation framework that employs parallel Mamba encoders to efficiently model RGB images and event streams. To reduce cross-modal ambiguity, we introduce the Dual-Dimensional Interaction Module (DDIM), comprising a Cross-Spatial Interaction Module (CSIM) and a Cross-Temporal Interaction Module (CTIM), which jointly perform fine-grained fusion along both spatial and temporal dimensions. This design improves cross-modal alignment, reduces ambiguity, and leverages the complementary properties of each modality. Extensive experiments on the DDD17 and DSEC datasets demonstrate that MambaSeg achieves state-of-the-art segmentation performance while significantly reducing computational cost, showcasing its promise for efficient, scalable, and robust multimodal perception.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: CBCT中的金属伪影严重遮挡解剖结构，影响诊断。现有深度学习方法存在局限：监督方法因"回归到均值"导致光谱模糊，无监督方法存在结构幻觉风险，而扩散模型虽然真实但依赖缓慢的随机迭代采样，不适合临床应用。

Conclusion: PGMP框架成功解决了CBCT金属伪影减少的关键挑战，通过物理基础模拟、确定性单次预测和语义对齐，实现了高效、可靠且临床适用的伪影去除解决方案。

Abstract: Metal artifacts in Dental CBCT severely obscure anatomical structures, hindering diagnosis. Current deep learning for Metal Artifact Reduction (MAR) faces limitations: supervised methods suffer from spectral blurring due to "regression-to-the-mean", while unsupervised ones risk structural hallucinations. Denoising Diffusion Models (DDPMs) offer realism but rely on slow, stochastic iterative sampling, unsuitable for clinical use. To resolve this, we propose the Physically-Grounded Manifold Projection (PGMP) framework. First, our Anatomically-Adaptive Physics Simulation (AAPS) pipeline synthesizes high-fidelity training pairs via Monte Carlo spectral modeling and patient-specific digital twins, bridging the synthetic-to-real gap. Second, our DMP-Former adapts the Direct x-Prediction paradigm, reformulating restoration as a deterministic manifold projection to recover clean anatomy in a single forward pass, eliminating stochastic sampling. Finally, a Semantic-Structural Alignment (SSA) module anchors the solution using priors from medical foundation models (MedDINOv3), ensuring clinical plausibility. Experiments on synthetic and multi-center clinical datasets show PGMP outperforms state-of-the-art methods on unseen anatomy, setting new benchmarks in efficiency and diagnostic reliability.

However, they suffer from a critical vulnerability: an over-reliance on language priors, which can lead to visual ungrounded hallucinations, especially when processing counterfactual videos that defy common sense. This limitation, stemming from the intrinsic data imbalance between text and video, is challenging to address due to the substantial cost of collecting and annotating counterfactual data. To address this, we introduce DualityForge, a novel counterfactual data synthesis framework that employs controllable, diffusion-based video editing to transform real-world videos into counterfactual scenarios. By embedding structured contextual information into the video editing and QA generation processes, the framework automatically produces high-quality QA pairs together with original-edited video pairs for contrastive training. Based on this, we build DualityVidQA, a large-scale video dataset designed to reduce MLLM hallucinations. In addition, to fully exploit the contrastive nature of our paired data, we propose Duality-Normalized Advantage Training (DNA-Train), a two-stage SFT-RL training regime where the RL phase applies pair-wise $\ell_1$ advantage normalization, thereby enabling a more stable and efficient policy optimization. Experiments on DualityVidQA-Test demonstrate that our method substantially reduces model hallucinations on counterfactual videos, yielding a relative improvement of 24.0% over the Qwen2.5-VL-7B baseline. Moreover, our approach achieves significant gains across both hallucination and general-purpose benchmarks, indicating strong generalization capability. We will open-source our dataset and code.

*Yuan Jia,Ruimin Wu,Rui Song,Jiaojiao Li,Bin Song*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出空间提升全景拼接框架，将2D图像提升为3D点云表示，通过统一投影中心生成几何一致的360°全景图，有效减少视差和遮挡场景中的几何失真和重影。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统图像拼接技术主要使用2D单应性变换和网格变形，适用于近似共面或视差较小的场景，但在真实3D场景（多深度层和遮挡）中会导致重影、结构弯曲和拉伸失真，特别是在多视角累积和360°闭环拼接场景中问题更加严重。

Method: 1. 将输入图像提升为统一坐标系中的密集3D点表示，通过置信度度量进行全局跨视图融合；2. 在3D空间中建立统一投影中心，使用等距柱面投影将融合数据映射到单一全景流形；3. 在画布域进行空洞填充以处理视角转换揭示的未知区域，恢复连续纹理和语义一致性。

Result: 实验评估表明，该方法在显著视差和复杂遮挡场景中大幅减少了几何失真和重影伪影，产生了更自然、更一致的全景结果。

Conclusion: 该框架将拼接从2D变形范式重新概念化为3D一致性范式，能够灵活整合各种3D提升和补全模块，为处理复杂3D场景的全景拼接提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Traditional image stitching techniques have predominantly utilized two-dimensional homography transformations and mesh warping to achieve alignment on a planar surface. While effective for scenes that are approximately coplanar or exhibit minimal parallax, these approaches often result in ghosting, structural bending, and stretching distortions in non-overlapping regions when applied to real three-dimensional scenes characterized by multiple depth layers and occlusions. Such challenges are exacerbated in multi-view accumulations and 360° closed-loop stitching scenarios. In response, this study introduces a spatially lifted panoramic stitching framework that initially elevates each input image into a dense three-dimensional point representation within a unified coordinate system, facilitating global cross-view fusion augmented by confidence metrics. Subsequently, a unified projection center is established in three-dimensional space, and an equidistant cylindrical projection is employed to map the fused data onto a single panoramic manifold, thereby producing a geometrically consistent 360° panoramic layout. Finally, hole filling is conducted within the canvas domain to address unknown regions revealed by viewpoint transitions, restoring continuous texture and semantic coherence. This framework reconceptualizes stitching from a two-dimensional warping paradigm to a three-dimensional consistency paradigm and is designed to flexibly incorporate various three-dimensional lifting and completion modules. Experimental evaluations demonstrate that the proposed method substantially mitigates geometric distortions and ghosting artifacts in scenarios involving significant parallax and complex occlusions, yielding panoramic results that are more natural and consistent.

TL;DR: 开发并验证了Virtual-Eyes CT质量控制流程，发现针对解剖结构的预处理能提升通用基础模型性能，但会破坏适应原始临床环境的专用模型


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在低剂量CT肺癌筛查的深度学习流程中，鲁棒的预处理很少被量化评估。需要开发临床驱动的质量控制流程，并评估其对不同类型模型的影响差异

Method: 开发Virtual-Eyes 16位CT质量控制流程：强制512x512平面分辨率、剔除短序列或非诊断序列、通过亨氏单位滤波和双侧肺覆盖评分提取连续肺块并保留原生16位网格。使用765名NLST患者数据，计算RAD-DINO和Merlin的切片级嵌入，训练无泄漏的患者级MLP头，同时评估Sybil和2D ResNet-18基线模型

Result: Virtual-Eyes显著提升RAD-DINO性能：切片级AUC从0.576升至0.610，患者级AUC从0.646升至0.683（平均池化）和0.619升至0.735（最大池化），校准改善（Brier分数从0.188降至0.112）。相反，Sybil和ResNet-18在Virtual-Eyes下性能下降（Sybil AUC从0.886降至0.837；ResNet-18 AUC从0.571微升至0.596），Merlin显示有限可迁移性（AUC约0.507至0.567）

Conclusion: 针对解剖结构的质量控制可以稳定并改进通用基础模型工作流程，但可能破坏已适应原始临床环境的专用模型，揭示了模型对预处理敏感性的重要差异

Abstract: Robust preprocessing is rarely quantified in deep-learning pipelines for low-dose CT (LDCT) lung cancer screening. We develop and validate Virtual-Eyes, a clinically motivated 16-bit CT quality-control pipeline, and measure its differential impact on generalist foundation models versus specialist models. Virtual-Eyes enforces strict 512x512 in-plane resolution, rejects short or non-diagnostic series, and extracts a contiguous lung block using Hounsfield-unit filtering and bilateral lung-coverage scoring while preserving the native 16-bit grid. Using 765 NLST patients (182 cancer, 583 non-cancer), we compute slice-level embeddings from RAD-DINO and Merlin with frozen encoders and train leakage-free patient-level MLP heads; we also evaluate Sybil and a 2D ResNet-18 baseline under Raw versus Virtual-Eyes inputs without backbone retraining. Virtual-Eyes improves RAD-DINO slice-level AUC from 0.576 to 0.610 and patient-level AUC from 0.646 to 0.683 (mean pooling) and from 0.619 to 0.735 (max pooling), with improved calibration (Brier score 0.188 to 0.112). In contrast, Sybil and ResNet-18 degrade under Virtual-Eyes (Sybil AUC 0.886 to 0.837; ResNet-18 AUC 0.571 to 0.596) with evidence of context dependence and shortcut learning, and Merlin shows limited transferability (AUC approximately 0.507 to 0.567) regardless of preprocessing. These results demonstrate that anatomically targeted QC can stabilize and improve generalist foundation-model workflows but may disrupt specialist models adapted to raw clinical context.

TL;DR: UniAct是一个两阶段框架，通过微调MLLM和因果流式管道，实现人形机器人以低于500ms延迟执行多模态指令，在零样本跟踪不完美参考运动方面提升了19%的成功率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 人形机器人领域长期目标是实现能够遵循多样化多模态指令的通用智能体，但现有方法在将高层次多模态感知与全身执行相结合方面存在瓶颈，难以将语言、音乐、轨迹等异构指令转化为稳定、实时的动作。

Method: 提出UniAct两阶段框架：1) 集成微调的多模态大语言模型(MLLM)与因果流式管道；2) 通过FSQ共享离散码本统一输入，确保跨模态对齐同时将运动约束在物理可行的流形上；3) 在UniMoCap（20小时人形运动基准）上进行验证。

Result: 实现了低于500ms的延迟执行多模态指令，在零样本跟踪不完美参考运动方面获得19%的成功率提升，在多样化真实场景中展示了鲁棒的泛化能力。

Conclusion: UniAct标志着向响应式、通用人形助手迈出了关键一步，通过统一的感知与控制实现了无缝交互，为人形机器人领域提供了有效的多模态指令执行解决方案。

Abstract: A long-standing objective in humanoid robotics is the realization of versatile agents capable of following diverse multimodal instructions with human-level flexibility. Despite advances in humanoid control, bridging high-level multimodal perception with whole-body execution remains a significant bottleneck. Existing methods often struggle to translate heterogeneous instructions -- such as language, music, and trajectories -- into stable, real-time actions. Here we show that UniAct, a two-stage framework integrating a fine-tuned MLLM with a causal streaming pipeline, enables humanoid robots to execute multimodal instructions with sub-500 ms latency. By unifying inputs through a shared discrete codebook via FSQ, UniAct ensures cross-modal alignment while constraining motions to a physically grounded manifold. This approach yields a 19% improvement in the success rate of zero-shot tracking of imperfect reference motions. We validate UniAct on UniMoCap, our 20-hour humanoid motion benchmark, demonstrating robust generalization across diverse real-world scenarios. Our results mark a critical step toward responsive, general-purpose humanoid assistants capable of seamless interaction through unified perception and control.

TL;DR: LVLDrive是一个将LiDAR点云作为额外输入模态，增强视觉语言模型3D度量空间理解能力的自动驾驶框架，通过渐进融合机制解决3D数据对预训练模型的干扰问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于视觉的视觉语言模型在自动驾驶中依赖2D图像线索，缺乏准确的度量空间推理和几何推断能力，导致驾驶策略不可靠，需要引入3D度量数据来提升安全性和可靠性。

Method: 提出LVLDrive框架，通过引入LiDAR点云作为额外输入模态；设计渐进融合Q-Former逐步注入LiDAR特征，保持预训练VLM知识稳定性；构建空间感知问答数据集(SA-QA)专门训练模型的3D感知和推理能力。

Result: 在多个驾驶基准测试中，LVLDrive在场景理解、度量空间感知和可靠驾驶决策方面均优于纯视觉方法，证明了3D度量数据对构建可信VLM自动驾驶系统的必要性。

Conclusion: LVLDrive通过融合LiDAR点云显著提升了视觉语言模型的3D度量空间理解能力，为构建更安全可靠的基于VLM的自动驾驶系统提供了有效解决方案，强调了显式3D度量数据的重要性。

Abstract: While Vision-Language Models (VLMs) show significant promise for end-to-end autonomous driving by leveraging the common sense embedded in language models, their reliance on 2D image cues for complex scene understanding and decision-making presents a critical bottleneck for safety and reliability. Current image-based methods struggle with accurate metric spatial reasoning and geometric inference, leading to unreliable driving policies. To bridge this gap, we propose LVLDrive (LiDAR-Vision-Language), a novel framework specifically designed to upgrade existing VLMs with robust 3D metric spatial understanding for autonomous driving by incoperating LiDAR point cloud as an extra input modality. A key challenge lies in mitigating the catastrophic disturbance introduced by disparate 3D data to the pre-trained VLMs. To this end, we introduce a Gradual Fusion Q-Former that incrementally injects LiDAR features, ensuring the stability and preservation of the VLM's existing knowledge base. Furthermore, we develop a spatial-aware question-answering (SA-QA) dataset to explicitly teach the model advanced 3D perception and reasoning capabilities. Extensive experiments on driving benchmarks demonstrate that LVLDrive achieves superior performance compared to vision-only counterparts across scene understanding, metric spatial perception, and reliable driving decision-making. Our work highlights the necessity of explicit 3D metric data for building trustworthy VLM-based autonomous systems.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有皮肤病图像分析数据集主要关注皮肤镜图像，缺乏患者自述查询和临床背景，限制了其在以患者为中心的护理中的应用。需要填补这一空白。

Method: 引入皮肤病评估框架(DAS)，包含36个高级和27个细粒度评估问题，提供专家标注的封闭式问答和分割数据集，评估多种多模态模型和提示策略。

Result: 分割任务中，默认提示在Mean-of-Max和Mean-of-Mean评估中表现最佳，增强提示在多数投票评估中Jaccard指数0.395，Dice分数0.566。封闭式问答中，o3模型准确率最高(0.798)，GPT-4.1(0.796)和Gemini-1.5-Pro(0.783)表现优异。

Conclusion: DermaVQA-DAS数据集、DAS框架和评估协议公开可用，将支持以患者为中心的皮肤病视觉语言建模研究，促进临床应用的进步。

Abstract: Recent advances in dermatological image analysis have been driven by large-scale annotated datasets; however, most existing benchmarks focus on dermatoscopic images and lack patient-authored queries and clinical context, limiting their applicability to patient-centered care. To address this gap, we introduce DermaVQA-DAS, an extension of the DermaVQA dataset that supports two complementary tasks: closed-ended question answering (QA) and dermatological lesion segmentation. Central to this work is the Dermatology Assessment Schema (DAS), a novel expert-developed framework that systematically captures clinically meaningful dermatological features in a structured and standardized form. DAS comprises 36 high-level and 27 fine-grained assessment questions, with multiple-choice options in English and Chinese. Leveraging DAS, we provide expert-annotated datasets for both closed QA and segmentation and benchmark state-of-the-art multimodal models. For segmentation, we evaluate multiple prompting strategies and show that prompt design impacts performance: the default prompt achieves the best results under Mean-of-Max and Mean-of-Mean evaluation aggregation schemes, while an augmented prompt incorporating both patient query title and content yields the highest performance under majority-vote-based microscore evaluation, achieving a Jaccard index of 0.395 and a Dice score of 0.566 with BiomedParse. For closed-ended QA, overall performance is strong across models, with average accuracies ranging from 0.729 to 0.798; o3 achieves the best overall accuracy (0.798), closely followed by GPT-4.1 (0.796), while Gemini-1.5-Pro shows competitive performance within the Gemini family (0.783). We publicly release DermaVQA-DAS, the DAS schema, and evaluation protocols to support and accelerate future research in patient-centered dermatological vision-language modeling (https://osf.io/72rp3).

Abstract: The rapid advancement of autonomous systems, including self-driving vehicles and drones, has intensified the need to forge true Spatial Intelligence from multi-modal onboard sensor data. While foundation models excel in single-modal contexts, integrating their capabilities across diverse sensors like cameras and LiDAR to create a unified understanding remains a formidable challenge. This paper presents a comprehensive framework for multi-modal pre-training, identifying the core set of techniques driving progress toward this goal. We dissect the interplay between foundational sensor characteristics and learning strategies, evaluating the role of platform-specific datasets in enabling these advancements. Our central contribution is the formulation of a unified taxonomy for pre-training paradigms: ranging from single-modality baselines to sophisticated unified frameworks that learn holistic representations for advanced tasks like 3D object detection and semantic occupancy prediction. Furthermore, we investigate the integration of textual inputs and occupancy representations to facilitate open-world perception and planning. Finally, we identify critical bottlenecks, such as computational efficiency and model scalability, and propose a roadmap toward general-purpose multi-modal foundation models capable of achieving robust Spatial Intelligence for real-world deployment.

Motivation: 现有基于分块的方法需要完整的非因果上下文窗口，导致显著延迟，无法满足真实对话中即时非语言反馈的需求

Method: 采用流友好的自回归框架，结合流匹配头部进行概率建模；提出由前瞻模块增强的因果编码器，在保持低延迟的同时利用短期未来上下文（如60ms）提升质量

Result: 每帧生成时间34ms，系统总延迟低于100ms；在HDTF数据集上达到离线8.13和在线7.61的LipSync Confidence分数，实现SOTA唇同步质量

Conclusion: DyStream通过创新的因果架构设计，在保证超低延迟的同时实现了高质量的实时双人对话头部视频生成，显著优于其他因果策略

Abstract: Generating realistic, dyadic talking head video requires ultra-low latency. Existing chunk-based methods require full non-causal context windows, introducing significant delays. This high latency critically prevents the immediate, non-verbal feedback required for a realistic listener. To address this, we present DyStream, a flow matching-based autoregressive model that could generate video in real-time from both speaker and listener audio. Our method contains two key designs: (1) we adopt a stream-friendly autoregressive framework with flow-matching heads for probabilistic modeling, and (2) We propose a causal encoder enhanced by a lookahead module to incorporate short future context (e.g., 60 ms) to improve quality while maintaining low latency. Our analysis shows this simple-and-effective method significantly surpass alternative causal strategies, including distillation and generative encoder. Extensive experiments show that DyStream could generate video within 34 ms per frame, guaranteeing the entire system latency remains under 100 ms. Besides, it achieves state-of-the-art lip-sync quality, with offline and online LipSync Confidence scores of 8.13 and 7.61 on HDTF, respectively. The model, weights and codes are available.

Abstract: The development of effective training and evaluation strategies is critical. Conventional methods for assessing surgical proficiency typically rely on expert supervision, either through onsite observation or retrospective analysis of recorded procedures. However, these approaches are inherently subjective, susceptible to inter-rater variability, and require substantial time and effort from expert surgeons. These demands are often impractical in low- and middle-income countries, thereby limiting the scalability and consistency of such methods across training programs. To address these limitations, we propose a novel AI-driven framework for the automated assessment of microanastomosis performance. The system integrates a video transformer architecture based on TimeSformer, improved with hierarchical temporal attention and weighted spatial attention mechanisms, to achieve accurate action recognition within surgical videos. Fine-grained motion features are then extracted using a YOLO-based object detection and tracking method, allowing for detailed analysis of instrument kinematics. Performance is evaluated along five aspects of microanastomosis skill, including overall action execution, motion quality during procedure-critical actions, and general instrument handling. Experimental validation using a dataset of 58 expert-annotated videos demonstrates the effectiveness of the system, achieving 87.7% frame-level accuracy in action segmentation that increased to 93.62% with post-processing, and an average classification accuracy of 76% in replicating expert assessments across all skill aspects. These findings highlight the system's potential to provide objective, consistent, and interpretable feedback, thereby enabling more standardized, data-driven training and evaluation in surgical education.

Result: 研究发现，单层DWT分解得到的基元产生的编码器表示在潜在空间中近似组合，这为理解ViT如何结构化信息提供了新视角。

Conclusion: Vision Transformer编码器的表示空间展现出一定程度的组合性，单层离散小波变换分解的基元能够近似组合重构原始表示，揭示了ViT结构化视觉信息的新机制。

Abstract: While insights into the workings of the transformer model have largely emerged by analysing their behaviour on language tasks, this work investigates the representations learnt by the Vision Transformer (ViT) encoder through the lens of compositionality. We introduce a framework, analogous to prior work on measuring compositionality in representation learning, to test for compositionality in the ViT encoder. Crucial to drawing this analogy is the Discrete Wavelet Transform (DWT), which is a simple yet effective tool for obtaining input-dependent primitives in the vision setting. By examining the ability of composed representations to reproduce original image representations, we empirically test the extent to which compositionality is respected in the representation space. Our findings show that primitives from a one-level DWT decomposition produce encoder representations that approximately compose in latent space, offering a new perspective on how ViTs structure information.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管AI在医学影像分类和检测任务上表现出色，但现有系统通常只输出结构化预测结果，需要放射科医生将其转化为完整的叙述性报告。大语言模型（如GPT-4）的出现为弥合这一差距提供了新机会，能够从结构化发现生成诊断性叙述。

Method: 研究引入了一个集成管道：首先使用YOLOv5和YOLOv8进行胸部X光图像异常检测，生成边界框预测和类别标签；然后将这些结构化结果输入大语言模型（LLM），生成描述性发现和临床总结。比较了YOLOv5和YOLOv8在检测精度、推理延迟方面的性能，并通过余弦相似度评估生成文本与真实报告的质量。

Result: 结果显示AI生成报告与人类报告具有强语义相似性。人类评估表明GPT-4在清晰度方面表现出色（4.88/5），但在自然写作流畅性方面得分较低（2.81/5）。这表明当前系统能够达到临床准确性，但在文体风格上仍可与放射科医生撰写的文本区分开来。

Conclusion: 该研究证明了结合目标检测模型和大语言模型的管道能够从医学影像生成临床准确的放射学报告，但生成的文本在自然流畅性方面仍有改进空间，需要进一步优化以更接近放射科医生的写作风格。

Abstract: Artificial intelligence (AI) has transformed medical imaging, with computer vision (CV) systems achieving state-of-the-art performance in classification and detection tasks. However, these systems typically output structured predictions, leaving radiologists responsible for translating results into full narrative reports. Recent advances in large language models (LLMs), such as GPT-4, offer new opportunities to bridge this gap by generating diagnostic narratives from structured findings. This study introduces a pipeline that integrates YOLOv5 and YOLOv8 for anomaly detection in chest X-ray images with a large language model (LLM) to generate natural-language radiology reports. The YOLO models produce bounding-box predictions and class labels, which are then passed to the LLM to generate descriptive findings and clinical summaries. YOLOv5 and YOLOv8 are compared in terms of detection accuracy, inference latency, and the quality of generated text, as measured by cosine similarity to ground-truth reports. Results show strong semantic similarity between AI and human reports, while human evaluation reveals GPT-4 excels in clarity (4.88/5) but exhibits lower scores for natural writing flow (2.81/5), indicating that current systems achieve clinical accuracy but remain stylistically distinguishable from radiologist-authored text.

Abstract: Recent advances in text-to-video (T2V) generation have achieved good visual quality, yet synthesizing videos that faithfully follow physical laws remains an open challenge. Existing methods mainly based on graphics or prompt extension struggle to generalize beyond simple simulated environments or learn implicit physical reasoning. The scarcity of training data with rich physics interactions and phenomena is also a problem. In this paper, we first introduce a Physics-Augmented video data construction Pipeline, PhyAugPipe, that leverages a vision-language model (VLM) with chain-of-thought reasoning to collect a large-scale training dataset, PhyVidGen-135K. Then we formulate a principled Physics-aware Groupwise Direct Preference Optimization, PhyGDPO, framework that builds upon the groupwise Plackett-Luce probabilistic model to capture holistic preferences beyond pairwise comparisons. In PhyGDPO, we design a Physics-Guided Rewarding (PGR) scheme that embeds VLM-based physics rewards to steer optimization toward physical consistency. We also propose a LoRA-Switch Reference (LoRA-SR) scheme that eliminates memory-heavy reference duplication for efficient training. Experiments show that our method significantly outperforms state-of-the-art open-source methods on PhyGenBench and VideoPhy2.

TL;DR: 论文提出DARFT框架，通过决策模糊性引导的强化微调来解决CDVQA中的决策模糊样本问题，提升模型区分能力


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究发现CDVQA模型失败案例中很大一部分不是明显错误预测，而是决策模糊性导致的问题，即模型对正确答案和强干扰项赋予相似置信度。这种决策模糊样本限制了模型的判别能力和鲁棒性。

Method: 提出DARFT框架：1) 使用SFT训练的策略挖掘决策模糊样本；2) 在挖掘的子集上应用组相对策略优化，利用多样本解码和组内相对优势来抑制强干扰项并锐化决策边界，无需额外监督。

Result: 大量实验表明，DARFT在SFT基线基础上取得一致性能提升，特别是在少样本设置下效果显著。

Conclusion: 明确优化决策模糊样本对于提升CDVQA模型的判别能力和鲁棒性至关重要，DARFT框架通过决策模糊性引导的强化微调有效解决了这一问题。

Abstract: Change detection visual question answering (CDVQA) requires answering text queries by reasoning about semantic changes in bi-temporal remote sensing images. A straightforward approach is to boost CDVQA performance with generic vision-language models via supervised fine-tuning (SFT). Despite recent progress, we observe that a significant portion of failures do not stem from clearly incorrect predictions, but from decision ambiguity, where the model assigns similar confidence to the correct answer and strong distractors. To formalize this challenge, we define Decision-Ambiguous Samples (DAS) as instances with a small probability margin between the ground-truth answer and the most competitive alternative. We argue that explicitly optimizing DAS is crucial for improving the discriminability and robustness of CDVQA models. To this end, we propose DARFT, a Decision-Ambiguity-guided Reinforcement Fine-Tuning framework that first mines DAS using an SFT-trained reference policy and then applies group-relative policy optimization on the mined subset. By leveraging multi-sample decoding and intra-group relative advantages, DARFT suppresses strong distractors and sharpens decision boundaries without additional supervision. Extensive experiments demonstrate consistent gains over SFT baselines, particularly under few-shot settings.

TL;DR: EVOL-SAM3：一种零样本推理分割框架，通过推理时进化搜索过程替代传统的静态推理范式，显著提升分割性能

Abstract: Reasoning Segmentation requires models to interpret complex, context-dependent linguistic queries to achieve pixel-level localization. Current dominant approaches rely heavily on Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) or Reinforcement Learning (RL). However, SFT suffers from catastrophic forgetting and domain dependency, while RL is often hindered by training instability and rigid reliance on predefined reward functions. Although recent training-free methods circumvent these training burdens, they are fundamentally limited by a static inference paradigm. These methods typically rely on a single-pass "generate-then-segment" chain, which suffers from insufficient reasoning depth and lacks the capability to self-correct linguistic hallucinations or spatial misinterpretations. In this paper, we challenge these limitations and propose EVOL-SAM3, a novel zero-shot framework that reformulates reasoning segmentation as an inference-time evolutionary search process. Instead of relying on a fixed prompt, EVOL-SAM3 maintains a population of prompt hypotheses and iteratively refines them through a "Generate-Evaluate-Evolve" loop. We introduce a Visual Arena to assess prompt fitness via reference-free pairwise tournaments, and a Semantic Mutation operator to inject diversity and correct semantic errors. Furthermore, a Heterogeneous Arena module integrates geometric priors with semantic reasoning to ensure robust final selection. Extensive experiments demonstrate that EVOL-SAM3 not only substantially outperforms static baselines but also significantly surpasses fully supervised state-of-the-art methods on the challenging ReasonSeg benchmark in a zero-shot setting.

TL;DR: SliceLens：一个基于LLM/VLM的假设驱动框架，用于在多实例视觉任务（检测、分割、姿态估计）中发现细粒度、可解释的错误切片，并提出了首个细粒度切片发现基准FeSD。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有切片发现方法主要针对图像分类任务，难以适用于多实例视觉任务。真实场景中的错误切片通常涉及复杂视觉关系，现有实例级方法缺乏细粒度推理能力。当前基准测试通常针对特定算法或偏向图像分类，且使用人工合成的地面真值，无法反映真实模型失败情况。

Result: 在现有基准和FeSD基准上的广泛实验表明，SliceLens实现了最先进的性能：在FeSD上Precision@10提升0.42（0.73 vs. 0.31）。识别出的可解释切片有助于可操作的模型改进，通过模型修复实验验证了其有效性。

Conclusion: SliceLens通过结合LLM/VLM的视觉推理能力，成功解决了多实例视觉任务中细粒度错误切片发现的挑战。提出的FeSD基准为评估细粒度切片发现提供了首个专门基准。该方法在识别可解释错误切片方面表现出色，并能有效指导模型改进。

Abstract: Systematic failures of computer vision models on subsets with coherent visual patterns, known as error slices, pose a critical challenge for robust model evaluation. Existing slice discovery methods are primarily developed for image classification, limiting their applicability to multi-instance tasks such as detection, segmentation, and pose estimation. In real-world scenarios, error slices often arise from corner cases involving complex visual relationships, where existing instance-level approaches lacking fine-grained reasoning struggle to yield meaningful insights. Moreover, current benchmarks are typically tailored to specific algorithms or biased toward image classification, with artificial ground truth that fails to reflect real model failures. To address these limitations, we propose SliceLens, a hypothesis-driven framework that leverages LLMs and VLMs to generate and verify diverse failure hypotheses through grounded visual reasoning, enabling reliable identification of fine-grained and interpretable error slices. We further introduce FeSD (Fine-grained Slice Discovery), the first benchmark specifically designed for evaluating fine-grained error slice discovery across instance-level vision tasks, featuring expert-annotated and carefully refined ground-truth slices with precise grounding to local error regions. Extensive experiments on both existing benchmarks and FeSD demonstrate that SliceLens achieves state-of-the-art performance, improving Precision@10 by 0.42 (0.73 vs. 0.31) on FeSD, and identifies interpretable slices that facilitate actionable model improvements, as validated through model repair experiments.

Abstract: The increasing frequency of natural disasters poses severe threats to human lives and leads to substantial economic losses. While 3D semantic segmentation is crucial for post-disaster assessment, existing deep learning models lack datasets specifically designed for post-disaster environments. To address this gap, we constructed a specialized 3D dataset using unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs)-captured aerial footage of Hurricane Ian (2022) over affected areas, employing Structure-from-Motion (SfM) and Multi-View Stereo (MVS) techniques to reconstruct 3D point clouds. We evaluated the state-of-the-art (SOTA) 3D semantic segmentation models, Fast Point Transformer (FPT), Point Transformer v3 (PTv3), and OA-CNNs on this dataset, exposing significant limitations in existing methods for disaster-stricken regions.

Abstract: Cross-modal systems trained on 2D visual inputs are presented with a dimensional shift when processing 3D scenes. An in-scene camera bridges the dimensionality gap but requires learning a control module. We introduce a new method that improves multivariate mutual information estimates by regret minimisation with derivative-free optimisation. Our algorithm enables off-the-shelf cross-modal systems trained on 2D visual inputs to adapt online to object occlusions and differentiate features. The pairing of expressive measures and value-based optimisation assists control of an in-scene camera to learn directly from the noisy outputs of vision-language models. The resulting pipeline improves performance in cross-modal tasks on multi-object 3D scenes without resorting to pretraining or finetuning.

Method: 提出协作低秩适应(CLoRA)，包含基础空间共享和样本无关多样性增强(SADE)组件。所有低秩模块共享一组下/上投影空间，从共享空间获得的低秩矩阵协作构建每个LRM。SADE通过正则化矩阵间相似性来鼓励训练过程中的多样化表示

Conclusion: CLoRA通过基础空间共享和多样性增强机制，有效解决了现有LoRA方法在性能与效率之间的权衡问题，为视觉Transformer微调提供了更优的解决方案

Abstract: Low-rank adaptation (LoRA) has achieved remarkable success in fine-tuning pre-trained vision transformers for various downstream tasks. Existing studies mainly focus on exploring more parameter-efficient strategies or more effective representation learning schemes. However, these methods either sacrifice fine-tuning performance or introduce excessive trainable parameters, failing to strike a balance between learning performance and parameter efficiency. To address this problem, we propose a novel tuning method named collaborative low-rank adaptation (CLoRA) in this paper. CLoRA consists of base-space sharing and sample-agnostic diversity enhancement (SADE) components. To maintain parameter efficiency while expanding the learning capacity of low-rank modules (LRMs), base-space sharing allows all LRMs to share a set of down/up-projection spaces. In CLoRA, the low-rank matrices obtained from the shared spaces collaboratively construct each LRM. Since the representations extracted by these matrices may contain redundant information, SADE is employed to regularize the similarities among them to encourage diverse representations in the training process. We conduct extensive experiments on widely used image and point cloud datasets to evaluate the performance of CLoRA. Experimental results demonstrate that CLoRA strikes a better balance between learning performance and parameter efficiency, while requiring the fewest GFLOPs for point cloud analysis, compared with the state-of-the-art methods.

Abstract: 3D visual grounding aims to localize the object in 3D point cloud scenes that semantically corresponds to given natural language sentences. It is very critical for roadside infrastructure system to interpret natural languages and localize relevant target objects in complex traffic environments. However, most existing datasets and approaches for 3D visual grounding focus on the indoor and outdoor driving scenes, outdoor monitoring scenarios remain unexplored due to scarcity of paired point cloud-text data captured by roadside infrastructure sensors. In this paper, we introduce a novel task of 3D Visual Grounding for Outdoor Monitoring Scenarios, which enables infrastructure-level understanding of traffic scenes beyond the ego-vehicle perspective. To support this task, we construct MoniRefer, the first real-world large-scale multi-modal dataset for roadside-level 3D visual grounding. The dataset consists of about 136,018 objects with 411,128 natural language expressions collected from multiple complex traffic intersections in the real-world environments. To ensure the quality and accuracy of the dataset, we manually verified all linguistic descriptions and 3D labels for objects. Additionally, we also propose a new end-to-end method, named Moni3DVG, which utilizes the rich appearance information provided by images and geometry and optical information from point cloud for multi-modal feature learning and 3D object localization. Extensive experiments and ablation studies on the proposed benchmarks demonstrate the superiority and effectiveness of our method. Our dataset and code will be released.

Abstract: Object detection in fire rescue scenarios is importance for command and decision-making in firefighting operations. However, existing research still suffers from two main limitations. First, current work predominantly focuses on environments such as mountainous or forest areas, while paying insufficient attention to urban rescue scenes, which are more frequent and structurally complex. Second, existing detection systems include a limited number of classes, such as flames and smoke, and lack a comprehensive system covering key targets crucial for command decisions, such as fire trucks and firefighters. To address the above issues, this paper first constructs a new dataset named "FireRescue" for rescue command, which covers multiple rescue scenarios, including urban, mountainous, forest, and water areas, and contains eight key categories such as fire trucks and firefighters, with a total of 15,980 images and 32,000 bounding boxes. Secondly, to tackle the problems of inter-class confusion and missed detection of small targets caused by chaotic scenes, diverse targets, and long-distance shooting, this paper proposes an improved model named FRS-YOLO. On the one hand, the model introduces a plug-and-play multidi-mensional collaborative enhancement attention module, which enhances the discriminative representation of easily confused categories (e.g., fire trucks vs. ordinary trucks) through cross-dimensional feature interaction. On the other hand, it integrates a dynamic feature sampler to strengthen high-response foreground features, thereby mitigating the effects of smoke occlusion and background interference. Experimental results demonstrate that object detection in fire rescue scenarios is highly challenging, and the proposed method effectively improves the detection performance of YOLO series models in this context.

Evaluated on CDDMBench, CPJ significantly improves performance: using GPT-5-mini captions, GPT-5-Nano achieves \textbf{+22.7} pp in disease classification and \textbf{+19.5} points in QA score over no-caption baselines. The framework provides transparent, evidence-based reasoning, advancing robust and explainable agricultural diagnosis without fine-tuning.

Conclusion: 通过径向并行预测与动态输出修正的结合，RadAR为自回归视觉生成提供了一种高效且可并行化的解决方案，有效解决了传统顺序解码的效率瓶颈问题。

Abstract: Inspired by the remarkable success of autoregressive models in language modeling, this paradigm has been widely adopted in visual generation. However, the sequential token-by-token decoding mechanism inherent in traditional autoregressive models leads to low inference efficiency.In this paper, we propose RadAR, an efficient and parallelizable framework designed to accelerate autoregressive visual generation while preserving its representational capacity. Our approach is motivated by the observation that visual tokens exhibit strong local dependencies and spatial correlations with their neighbors--a property not fully exploited in standard raster-scan decoding orders. Specifically, we organize the generation process around a radial topology: an initial token is selected as the starting point, and all other tokens are systematically grouped into multiple concentric rings according to their spatial distances from this center. Generation then proceeds in a ring-wise manner, from inner to outer regions, enabling the parallel prediction of all tokens within the same ring. This design not only preserves the structural locality and spatial coherence of visual scenes but also substantially increases parallelization. Furthermore, to address the risk of inconsistent predictions arising from simultaneous token generation with limited context, we introduce a nested attention mechanism. This mechanism dynamically refines implausible outputs during the forward pass, thereby mitigating error accumulation and preventing model collapse. By integrating radial parallel prediction with dynamic output correction, RadAR significantly improves generation efficiency.

Abstract: Vision Language Models (VLMs) are increasingly adopted as central reasoning modules for embodied agents. Existing benchmarks evaluate their capabilities under ideal, well-lit conditions, yet robust 24/7 operation demands performance under a wide range of visual degradations, including low-light conditions at night or in dark environments--a core necessity that has been largely overlooked. To address this underexplored challenge, we present DarkEQA, an open-source benchmark for evaluating EQA-relevant perceptual primitives under multi-level low-light conditions. DarkEQA isolates the perception bottleneck by evaluating question answering from egocentric observations under controlled degradations, enabling attributable robustness analysis. A key design feature of DarkEQA is its physical fidelity: visual degradations are modeled in linear RAW space, simulating physics-based illumination drop and sensor noise followed by an ISP-inspired rendering pipeline. We demonstrate the utility of DarkEQA by evaluating a wide range of state-of-the-art VLMs and Low-Light Image Enhancement (LLIE) models. Our analysis systematically reveals VLMs' limitations when operating under these challenging visual conditions. Our code and benchmark dataset will be released upon acceptance.

Abstract: The recent advent of 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has marked a significant breakthrough in real-time novel view synthesis. However, the rapid proliferation of 3DGS-based algorithms has created a pressing need for standardized and comprehensive evaluation tools, especially for compression task. Existing benchmarks often lack the specific metrics necessary to holistically assess the unique characteristics of different methods, such as rendering speed, rate distortion trade-offs memory efficiency, and geometric accuracy. To address this gap, we introduce Splatwizard, a unified benchmark toolkit designed specifically for benchmarking 3DGS compression models. Splatwizard provides an easy-to-use framework to implement new 3DGS compression model and utilize state-of-the-art techniques proposed by previous work. Besides, an integrated pipeline that automates the calculation of key performance indicators, including image-based quality metrics, chamfer distance of reconstruct mesh, rendering frame rates, and computational resource consumption is included in the framework as well.

TL;DR: 提出统一框架将3D高斯分割的两阶段方法合并，通过可学习特征嵌入和Embedding-to-Label过程提升性能，并引入边界硬采样和线性层稳定训练


<details>

Motivation: 现有3D分割方法存在2D实例标签跨视图不一致的问题，导致3D预测质量差。现有方法要么使用超参数敏感的对比学习聚类，要么预处理标签保证一致性，都是两阶段方法，训练时间长且性能有限。

Method: 提出统一框架：1) 为高斯基元引入可学习特征嵌入进行分割；2) 通过新颖的"Embedding-to-Label"过程高效解码为实例标签；3) 针对边界伪影问题，提出边界硬采样策略；4) 在计算三元组损失前对光栅化特征嵌入应用线性层以稳定训练。

Result: 在ScanNet、Replica3D和Messy-Rooms数据集上，方法在定性和定量评估中均优于基线方法，减少了训练时间并提高了分割性能。

Conclusion: 提出的统一框架成功解决了多视图2D分割标签不一致的问题，通过合并优化步骤提高了效率和性能，边界硬采样和线性层稳定化进一步提升了分割质量。

Abstract: 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) and Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) have advanced novel-view synthesis. Recent methods extend multi-view 2D segmentation to 3D, enabling instance/semantic segmentation for better scene understanding. A key challenge is the inconsistency of 2D instance labels across views, leading to poor 3D predictions. Existing methods use a two-stage approach in which some rely on contrastive learning with hyperparameter-sensitive clustering, while others preprocess labels for consistency. We propose a unified framework that merges these steps, reducing training time and improving performance by introducing a learnable feature embedding for segmentation in Gaussian primitives. This embedding is then efficiently decoded into instance labels through a novel "Embedding-to-Label" process, effectively integrating the optimization. While this unified framework offers substantial benefits, we observed artifacts at the object boundaries. To address the object boundary issues, we propose hard-mining samples along these boundaries. However, directly applying hard mining to the feature embeddings proved unstable. Therefore, we apply a linear layer to the rasterized feature embeddings before calculating the triplet loss, which stabilizes training and significantly improves performance. Our method outperforms baselines qualitatively and quantitatively on the ScanNet, Replica3D, and Messy-Rooms datasets.

TL;DR: SpaceTimePilot是一个视频扩散模型，通过解耦空间和时间实现可控生成渲染，能够独立改变摄像机视角和运动序列，实现连续的空间-时间探索。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视频生成模型难以实现对空间（摄像机视角）和时间（运动序列）的独立精确控制，缺乏能够同时处理这两种维度的可控生成方法。

Method: 1) 引入动画时间嵌入机制，在扩散过程中显式控制输出视频的运动序列；2) 提出时间扭曲训练方案，重新利用多视角数据集模拟时间差异；3) 改进摄像机条件机制，允许从第一帧开始改变摄像机；4) 创建CamxTime合成数据集，提供完整的空间-时间视频轨迹。

Result: 在真实世界和合成数据上的评估表明，SpaceTimePilot实现了清晰的空间-时间解耦，相比先前工作取得了更强的结果，能够精确控制摄像机视角和运动序列。

Conclusion: SpaceTimePilot成功实现了视频生成中空间和时间的解耦控制，通过创新的训练方案和数据集解决了缺乏配对时间变化视频数据的问题，为可控视频生成提供了新方法。

Abstract: We present SpaceTimePilot, a video diffusion model that disentangles space and time for controllable generative rendering. Given a monocular video, SpaceTimePilot can independently alter the camera viewpoint and the motion sequence within the generative process, re-rendering the scene for continuous and arbitrary exploration across space and time. To achieve this, we introduce an effective animation time-embedding mechanism in the diffusion process, allowing explicit control of the output video's motion sequence with respect to that of the source video. As no datasets provide paired videos of the same dynamic scene with continuous temporal variations, we propose a simple yet effective temporal-warping training scheme that repurposes existing multi-view datasets to mimic temporal differences. This strategy effectively supervises the model to learn temporal control and achieve robust space-time disentanglement. To further enhance the precision of dual control, we introduce two additional components: an improved camera-conditioning mechanism that allows altering the camera from the first frame, and CamxTime, the first synthetic space-and-time full-coverage rendering dataset that provides fully free space-time video trajectories within a scene. Joint training on the temporal-warping scheme and the CamxTime dataset yields more precise temporal control. We evaluate SpaceTimePilot on both real-world and synthetic data, demonstrating clear space-time disentanglement and strong results compared to prior work.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CropTrack是一个用于农业环境多目标跟踪的新框架，通过结合外观和运动信息来解决传统方法在遮挡和相似外观下的身份保持问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 农业环境中的多目标跟踪面临重复模式、相似外观、光照突变和频繁遮挡等挑战。现有跟踪器主要依赖运动信息，但在频繁强遮挡下难以保持目标身份，而相似外观又使得外观关联难以整合。

Method: CropTrack提出一个基于外观和运动信息结合的MOT框架，包含：1) 重排序增强的外观关联；2) 一对多关联与基于外观的冲突解决策略；3) 指数移动平均原型特征库来改进外观关联。

Result: 在公开农业MOT数据集上评估，CropTrack表现出稳定的身份保持能力，优于传统基于运动的跟踪方法。相比现有最佳方法，在识别F1分数和关联准确率上有显著提升，身份切换次数更低。

Conclusion: CropTrack通过有效整合外观和运动信息，解决了农业场景中多目标跟踪的身份保持难题，为相似外观和频繁遮挡环境下的目标跟踪提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Multiple-object tracking (MOT) in agricultural environments presents major challenges due to repetitive patterns, similar object appearances, sudden illumination changes, and frequent occlusions. Contemporary trackers in this domain rely on the motion of objects rather than appearance for association. Nevertheless, they struggle to maintain object identities when targets undergo frequent and strong occlusions. The high similarity of object appearances makes integrating appearance-based association nontrivial for agricultural scenarios. To solve this problem we propose CropTrack, a novel MOT framework based on the combination of appearance and motion information. CropTrack integrates a reranking-enhanced appearance association, a one-to-many association with appearance-based conflict resolution strategy, and an exponential moving average prototype feature bank to improve appearance-based association. Evaluated on publicly available agricultural MOT datasets, CropTrack demonstrates consistent identity preservation, outperforming traditional motion-based tracking methods. Compared to the state of the art, CropTrack achieves significant gains in identification F1 and association accuracy scores with a lower number of identity switches.

TL;DR: 本文提出了VLN-MME评估框架，用于在视觉语言导航任务中零样本测试多模态大语言模型作为具身智能体的能力，发现增强推理链和自反思反而导致性能下降，揭示了MLLMs在3D空间推理和上下文感知方面的局限性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 虽然多模态大语言模型在各种视觉语言任务中表现出色，但其作为具身智能体（需要多轮对话、空间推理和序列动作预测）的能力尚未充分探索。本文旨在系统评估MLLMs在视觉语言导航任务中的零样本表现。

Method: 提出了VLN-MME评估框架，将传统导航数据集转化为标准化基准测试。采用高度模块化和可访问的设计简化评估，支持跨不同MLLM架构、智能体设计和导航任务的结构化比较和组件级消融实验。

Result: 研究发现，在基线智能体基础上增强推理链和自反思机制反而导致性能下降。这表明MLLMs在具身导航任务中表现出较差的上下文感知能力：虽然能够遵循指令并结构化输出，但其3D空间推理保真度较低。

Conclusion: VLN-MME为系统评估通用MLLMs在具身导航环境中的能力奠定了基础，揭示了其在序列决策能力方面的局限性。这些发现为MLLMs作为具身智能体的后训练提供了重要指导。

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities across a wide range of vision-language tasks. However, their performance as embodied agents, which requires multi-round dialogue spatial reasoning and sequential action prediction, needs further exploration. Our work investigates this potential in the context of Vision-and-Language Navigation (VLN) by introducing a unified and extensible evaluation framework to probe MLLMs as zero-shot agents by bridging traditional navigation datasets into a standardized benchmark, named VLN-MME. We simplify the evaluation with a highly modular and accessible design. This flexibility streamlines experiments, enabling structured comparisons and component-level ablations across diverse MLLM architectures, agent designs, and navigation tasks. Crucially, enabled by our framework, we observe that enhancing our baseline agent with Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning and self-reflection leads to an unexpected performance decrease. This suggests MLLMs exhibit poor context awareness in embodied navigation tasks; although they can follow instructions and structure their output, their 3D spatial reasoning fidelity is low. VLN-MME lays the groundwork for systematic evaluation of general-purpose MLLMs in embodied navigation settings and reveals limitations in their sequential decision-making capabilities. We believe these findings offer crucial guidance for MLLM post-training as embodied agents.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基准在金融多模态推理评估方面存在不足，缺乏真实世界的金融场景、复杂的金融文档理解以及多步骤推理能力评估。需要建立一个更贴近实际金融应用场景的评估基准。

Method: 构建包含1,200个专家标注问题的双语多模态基准，其中57.9%的问题融入了12种隐含金融场景；包含837份中英文金融文档，涵盖9种类型，平均50.8页；问题平均需要11步推理（5.3步信息提取+5.7步计算），65.0%需要跨页证据。

Result: 最佳性能的MLLM仅达到58.0%的准确率，不同检索增强生成方法在该任务上表现出显著性能差异，表明当前模型在复杂金融多模态推理方面仍有很大提升空间。

Conclusion: FinMMDocR基准能够有效评估MLLM在真实世界金融场景下的复杂多模态推理能力，预计将推动MLLM和推理增强方法在复杂多模态推理任务上的改进。

Abstract: We introduce FinMMDocR, a novel bilingual multimodal benchmark for evaluating multimodal large language models (MLLMs) on real-world financial numerical reasoning. Compared to existing benchmarks, our work delivers three major advancements. (1) Scenario Awareness: 57.9% of 1,200 expert-annotated problems incorporate 12 types of implicit financial scenarios (e.g., Portfolio Management), challenging models to perform expert-level reasoning based on assumptions; (2) Document Understanding: 837 Chinese/English documents spanning 9 types (e.g., Company Research) average 50.8 pages with rich visual elements, significantly surpassing existing benchmarks in both breadth and depth of financial documents; (3) Multi-Step Computation: Problems demand 11-step reasoning on average (5.3 extraction + 5.7 calculation steps), with 65.0% requiring cross-page evidence (2.4 pages average). The best-performing MLLM achieves only 58.0% accuracy, and different retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) methods show significant performance variations on this task. We expect FinMMDocR to drive improvements in MLLMs and reasoning-enhanced methods on complex multimodal reasoning tasks in real-world scenarios.

Abstract: 3D object detectors are fundamental components of perception systems in autonomous vehicles. While these detectors achieve remarkable performance on standard autonomous driving benchmarks, they often struggle to generalize across different domains - for instance, a model trained in the U.S. may perform poorly in regions like Asia or Europe. This paper presents a novel lidar domain adaptation method based on neuron activation patterns, demonstrating that state-of-the-art performance can be achieved by annotating only a small, representative, and diverse subset of samples from the target domain if they are correctly selected. The proposed approach requires very small annotation budget and, when combined with post-training techniques inspired by continual learning prevent weight drift from the original model. Empirical evaluation shows that the proposed domain adaptation approach outperforms both linear probing and state-of-the-art domain adaptation techniques.

TL;DR: ProDM是一种生成扩散模型，用于从非门控胸部CT中恢复无运动伪影的冠状动脉钙化病灶，提高CAC评分准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 非门控胸部CT中的冠状动脉钙化评分受到心脏和呼吸运动伪影的严重影响，而ECG门控心脏CT在人群筛查和常规成像中应用有限。需要一种方法从常规非门控CT中准确量化CAC。

Method: 提出ProDM（Property-aware Progressive Correction Diffusion Model），包含三个关键组件：1) CAC运动模拟数据引擎，从心脏门控CT合成具有多样运动轨迹的非门控采集数据；2) 属性感知学习策略，通过可微钙化一致性损失融入钙化特定先验；3) 渐进校正方案，在扩散步骤中逐步减少伪影。

Result: 在真实患者数据集上，ProDM显著提高了CAC评分准确性、空间病灶保真度和风险分层性能。真实非门控扫描的读者研究证实ProDM能抑制运动伪影并提高临床可用性。

Conclusion: ProDM展示了渐进式、属性感知框架在从常规胸部CT成像中可靠量化CAC方面的潜力，为无门控CT的CAC评估提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Coronary artery calcium (CAC) scoring from chest CT is a well-established tool to stratify and refine clinical cardiovascular disease risk estimation. CAC quantification relies on the accurate delineation of calcified lesions, but is oftentimes affected by artifacts introduced by cardiac and respiratory motion. ECG-gated cardiac CTs substantially reduce motion artifacts, but their use in population screening and routine imaging remains limited due to gating requirements and lack of insurance coverage. Although identification of incidental CAC from non-gated chest CT is increasingly considered for it offers an accessible and widely available alternative, this modality is limited by more severe motion artifacts. We present ProDM (Property-aware Progressive Correction Diffusion Model), a generative diffusion framework that restores motion-free calcified lesions from non-gated CTs. ProDM introduces three key components: (1) a CAC motion simulation data engine that synthesizes realistic non-gated acquisitions with diverse motion trajectories directly from cardiac-gated CTs, enabling supervised training without paired data; (2) a property-aware learning strategy incorporating calcium-specific priors through a differentiable calcium consistency loss to preserve lesion integrity; and (3) a progressive correction scheme that reduces artifacts gradually across diffusion steps to enhance stability and calcium fidelity. Experiments on real patient datasets show that ProDM significantly improves CAC scoring accuracy, spatial lesion fidelity, and risk stratification performance compared with several baselines. A reader study on real non-gated scans further confirms that ProDM suppresses motion artifacts and improves clinical usability. These findings highlight the potential of progressive, property-aware frameworks for reliable CAC quantification from routine chest CT imaging.

Motivation: 当前视频生成模型展现出链式帧推理能力，但现有评估框架主要依赖单帧评估，容易导致结果作弊（模型通过错误过程得出正确结论），缺乏对推理过程的系统性评估。

Method: 1) 提出VIPER基准测试，涵盖16个任务，跨越时间、结构、符号、空间、物理和规划推理；2) 提出过程-结果一致性指标POC@r，使用VLM-as-Judge和分层评分标准来评估中间步骤有效性和最终结果；3) 进行实验分析，包括测试时缩放和采样鲁棒性研究。

Result: 实验显示：1) 最先进的视频模型仅达到约20%的POC@1.0一致性；2) 模型存在显著的结果作弊现象；3) 测试时缩放和采样鲁棒性分析揭示了当前视频生成与真正广义视觉推理之间的巨大差距。

Conclusion: 需要过程感知的评估范式来准确评估生成视频推理能力，VIPER基准和POC@r指标为此提供了系统框架，揭示了当前模型的局限性，为未来研究指明了方向。

Abstract: Recent breakthroughs in video generation have demonstrated an emerging capability termed Chain-of-Frames (CoF) reasoning, where models resolve complex tasks through the generation of continuous frames. While these models show promise for Generative Video Reasoning (GVR), existing evaluation frameworks often rely on single-frame assessments, which can lead to outcome-hacking, where a model reaches a correct conclusion through an erroneous process. To address this, we propose a process-aware evaluation paradigm. We introduce VIPER, a comprehensive benchmark spanning 16 tasks across temporal, structural, symbolic, spatial, physics, and planning reasoning. Furthermore, we propose Process-outcome Consistency (POC@r), a new metric that utilizes VLM-as-Judge with a hierarchical rubric to evaluate both the validity of the intermediate steps and the final result. Our experiments reveal that state-of-the-art video models achieve only about 20% POC@1.0 and exhibit a significant outcome-hacking. We further explore the impact of test-time scaling and sampling robustness, highlighting a substantial gap between current video generation and true generalized visual reasoning. Our benchmark will be publicly released.

Conclusion: RFL-ReID是比L-ReID更具挑战性的新任务，Bi-C2R框架通过特征兼容性学习有效解决了无需重新索引的终身行人重识别问题

Abstract: Lifelong person Re-IDentification (L-ReID) exploits sequentially collected data to continuously train and update a ReID model, focusing on the overall performance of all data. Its main challenge is to avoid the catastrophic forgetting problem of old knowledge while training on new data. Existing L-ReID methods typically re-extract new features for all historical gallery images for inference after each update, known as "re-indexing". However, historical gallery data typically suffers from direct saving due to the data privacy issue and the high re-indexing costs for large-scale gallery images. As a result, it inevitably leads to incompatible retrieval between query features extracted by the updated model and gallery features extracted by those before the update, greatly impairing the re-identification performance. To tackle the above issue, this paper focuses on a new task called Re-index Free Lifelong person Re-IDentification (RFL-ReID), which requires performing lifelong person re-identification without re-indexing historical gallery images. Therefore, RFL-ReID is more challenging than L-ReID, requiring continuous learning and balancing new and old knowledge in diverse streaming data, and making the features output by the new and old models compatible with each other. To this end, we propose a Bidirectional Continuous Compatible Representation (Bi-C2R) framework to continuously update the gallery features extracted by the old model to perform efficient L-ReID in a compatible manner. We verify our proposed Bi-C2R method through theoretical analysis and extensive experiments on multiple benchmarks, which demonstrate that the proposed method can achieve leading performance on both the introduced RFL-ReID task and the traditional L-ReID task.

Abstract: Audio-driven visual dubbing aims to synchronize a video's lip movements with new speech, but is fundamentally challenged by the lack of ideal training data: paired videos where only a subject's lip movements differ while all other visual conditions are identical. Existing methods circumvent this with a mask-based inpainting paradigm, where an incomplete visual conditioning forces models to simultaneously hallucinate missing content and sync lips, leading to visual artifacts, identity drift, and poor synchronization. In this work, we propose a novel self-bootstrapping framework that reframes visual dubbing from an ill-posed inpainting task into a well-conditioned video-to-video editing problem. Our approach employs a Diffusion Transformer, first as a data generator, to synthesize ideal training data: a lip-altered companion video for each real sample, forming visually aligned video pairs. A DiT-based audio-driven editor is then trained on these pairs end-to-end, leveraging the complete and aligned input video frames to focus solely on precise, audio-driven lip modifications. This complete, frame-aligned input conditioning forms a rich visual context for the editor, providing it with complete identity cues, scene interactions, and continuous spatiotemporal dynamics. Leveraging this rich context fundamentally enables our method to achieve highly accurate lip sync, faithful identity preservation, and exceptional robustness against challenging in-the-wild scenarios. We further introduce a timestep-adaptive multi-phase learning strategy as a necessary component to disentangle conflicting editing objectives across diffusion timesteps, thereby facilitating stable training and yielding enhanced lip synchronization and visual fidelity. Additionally, we propose ContextDubBench, a comprehensive benchmark dataset for robust evaluation in diverse and challenging practical application scenarios.

TL;DR: FineTec是一个用于处理时间损坏骨架序列的细粒度动作识别统一框架，通过上下文感知补全、空间分解和物理驱动估计来恢复细微运动线索，在多个基准测试中显著优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现实场景中在线姿态估计常产生大量缺失数据，现有方法难以准确恢复时间动态和细粒度空间结构，导致丢失区分相似动作的关键细微运动线索。

Method: 1) 上下文感知补全：使用多样化时间掩码从损坏输入恢复基础骨架序列；2) 骨架空间分解：将骨架分为五个语义区域，基于运动方差分为动态和静态子组，通过针对性扰动生成两个增强序列；3) 物理驱动估计：利用拉格朗日动力学估计关节加速度；4) GCN识别头：融合骨架位置序列和加速度序列进行动作识别。

Result: 在粗粒度(NTU-60, NTU-120)和细粒度(Gym99, Gym288)基准测试中显著优于先前方法，在Gym99-severe和Gym288-severe设置下分别达到89.1%和78.1%的top-1准确率。

Conclusion: FineTec通过统一框架有效处理时间损坏骨架序列，在保持鲁棒性和泛化能力的同时，显著提升了细粒度动作识别性能。

Abstract: Recognizing fine-grained actions from temporally corrupted skeleton sequences remains a significant challenge, particularly in real-world scenarios where online pose estimation often yields substantial missing data. Existing methods often struggle to accurately recover temporal dynamics and fine-grained spatial structures, resulting in the loss of subtle motion cues crucial for distinguishing similar actions. To address this, we propose FineTec, a unified framework for Fine-grained action recognition under Temporal Corruption. FineTec first restores a base skeleton sequence from corrupted input using context-aware completion with diverse temporal masking. Next, a skeleton-based spatial decomposition module partitions the skeleton into five semantic regions, further divides them into dynamic and static subgroups based on motion variance, and generates two augmented skeleton sequences via targeted perturbation. These, along with the base sequence, are then processed by a physics-driven estimation module, which utilizes Lagrangian dynamics to estimate joint accelerations. Finally, both the fused skeleton position sequence and the fused acceleration sequence are jointly fed into a GCN-based action recognition head. Extensive experiments on both coarse-grained (NTU-60, NTU-120) and fine-grained (Gym99, Gym288) benchmarks show that FineTec significantly outperforms previous methods under various levels of temporal corruption. Specifically, FineTec achieves top-1 accuracies of 89.1% and 78.1% on the challenging Gym99-severe and Gym288-severe settings, respectively, demonstrating its robustness and generalizability.

TL;DR: GaMO通过多视角外绘而非生成新视角来改进稀疏视图3D重建，在几何一致性和计算效率方面显著优于现有方法


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于扩散的方法虽然通过生成新视角来增强训练数据，但仍存在三个关键局限：已知视角外围覆盖不足、生成视图间几何不一致、计算流程昂贵。需要一种能保持几何一致性同时扩展场景覆盖的方法。

Method: GaMO将稀疏视图重建重新定义为多视角外绘问题，从现有相机位姿扩展视野而非生成新视角。采用多视角条件化和几何感知去噪策略，以零样本方式无需训练。通过保持原始相机几何来确保一致性。

Result: 在Replica和ScanNet++数据集上，GaMO在3、6、9个输入视图下均达到最先进的重建质量，PSNR和LPIPS指标优于先前方法，同时相比SOTA扩散方法实现25倍加速，处理时间低于10分钟。

Conclusion: GaMO通过多视角外绘范式有效解决了稀疏视图重建中的几何一致性和覆盖范围问题，在保持高质量重建的同时大幅提升计算效率，为实际应用提供了可行方案。

Abstract: Recent advances in 3D reconstruction have achieved remarkable progress in high-quality scene capture from dense multi-view imagery, yet struggle when input views are limited. Various approaches, including regularization techniques, semantic priors, and geometric constraints, have been implemented to address this challenge. Latest diffusion-based methods have demonstrated substantial improvements by generating novel views from new camera poses to augment training data, surpassing earlier regularization and prior-based techniques. Despite this progress, we identify three critical limitations in these state-of-the-art approaches: inadequate coverage beyond known view peripheries, geometric inconsistencies across generated views, and computationally expensive pipelines. We introduce GaMO (Geometry-aware Multi-view Outpainter), a framework that reformulates sparse-view reconstruction through multi-view outpainting. Instead of generating new viewpoints, GaMO expands the field of view from existing camera poses, which inherently preserves geometric consistency while providing broader scene coverage. Our approach employs multi-view conditioning and geometry-aware denoising strategies in a zero-shot manner without training. Extensive experiments on Replica and ScanNet++ demonstrate state-of-the-art reconstruction quality across 3, 6, and 9 input views, outperforming prior methods in PSNR and LPIPS, while achieving a $25\times$ speedup over SOTA diffusion-based methods with processing time under 10 minutes.

TL;DR: BanglaCodeAct：一个基于多智能体提示和迭代自校正的孟加拉语到Python代码生成框架，使用开源多语言LLM在Thought-Code-Observation循环中实现动态代码生成、测试和优化。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 虽然LLMs在英语提示的代码生成方面表现出色，但这种进展尚未扩展到低资源语言。本文针对孟加拉语到Python代码生成问题，旨在解决低资源语言代码生成的挑战。

Method: 提出BanglaCodeAct框架，采用基于智能体的方法，利用多智能体提示和迭代自校正。框架使用开源多语言LLM，在Thought-Code-Observation循环中实现动态代码生成、测试和优化，无需任务特定的微调。

Result: 在mHumanEval数据集的孟加拉语NL2Code任务上评估多个小型开源LLM。Qwen3-8B与BanglaCodeAct结合表现最佳，在开发集上达到94.0%的pass@1准确率，在盲测集上达到71.6%的准确率。

Conclusion: 为孟加拉语到Python翻译建立了新的基准，突显了基于智能体的推理在低资源语言可靠代码生成方面的潜力。实验脚本已公开。

Abstract: LLMs excel at code generation from English prompts, but this progress has not extended to low-resource languages. We address Bangla-to-Python code generation by introducing BanglaCodeAct, an agent-based framework that leverages multi-agent prompting and iterative self-correction. Unlike prior approaches relying on task-specific fine-tuning, BanglaCodeAct employs an open-source multilingual LLM within a Thought-Code-Observation loop, enabling dynamic generation, testing, and refinement of code from Bangla instructions. We benchmark several small-parameter open-source LLMs and evaluate their effectiveness on the mHumanEval dataset for Bangla NL2Code. Our results show that Qwen3-8B, when deployed with BanglaCodeAct, achieves the best performance, with pass@1 accuracy of 94.0\% on the development set and 71.6\% on the blind test set. These results establish a new benchmark for Bangla-to-Python translation and highlight the potential of agent-based reasoning for reliable code generation in low-resource languages.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: PharmaShip是一个真实世界的中文药品运输单据扫描数据集，用于在噪声OCR和异构模板下测试预训练文本布局模型，包含序列实体识别、关系抽取和阅读顺序预测三个任务。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为安全关键的药品领域文档理解建立受控、可复现的基准测试，在噪声OCR和异构模板条件下评估预训练文本布局模型的鲁棒性。

Method: 构建包含扫描药品运输单据的PharmaShip数据集，采用实体中心评估协议，对五个代表性基线模型（LiLT、LayoutLMv3-base、GeoLayoutLM及其RORE增强变体）进行标准化预处理、分割和优化。

Result: 像素信息和显式几何信息提供互补的归纳偏置，但单独使用都不够；注入阅读顺序导向的正则化能持续改进SER和EL；更长的位置覆盖能稳定后页预测并减少截断伪影；ROP在词级别准确但在片段级别具有挑战性。

Conclusion: PharmaShip为药品领域安全关键的文档理解建立了受控、可复现的基准，并强调序列感知约束作为结构建模的可迁移偏置的重要性。

Abstract: We present PharmaShip, a real-world Chinese dataset of scanned pharmaceutical shipping documents designed to stress-test pre-trained text-layout models under noisy OCR and heterogeneous templates. PharmaShip covers three complementary tasks-sequence entity recognition (SER), relation extraction (RE), and reading order prediction (ROP)-and adopts an entity-centric evaluation protocol to minimize confounds across architectures. We benchmark five representative baselines spanning pixel-aware and geometry-aware families (LiLT, LayoutLMv3-base, GeoLayoutLM and their available RORE-enhanced variants), and standardize preprocessing, splits, and optimization. Experiments show that pixels and explicit geometry provide complementary inductive biases, yet neither alone is sufficient: injecting reading-order-oriented regularization consistently improves SER and EL and yields the most robust configuration, while longer positional coverage stabilizes late-page predictions and reduces truncation artifacts. ROP is accurate at the word level but challenging at the segment level, reflecting boundary ambiguity and long-range crossings. PharmaShip thus establishes a controlled, reproducible benchmark for safety-critical document understanding in the pharmaceutical domain and highlights sequence-aware constraints as a transferable bias for structure modeling. We release the dataset at https://github.com/KevinYuLei/PharmaShip.

Method: 提出Luca-Noise Reflex Protocol (LN-RP)框架，通过向初始生成状态注入随机噪声种子，在152个生成周期中观察语言行为的非线性转变，分析熵特征和相位转变。

Result: 发现了三种稳定的人格模式，具有不同的熵特征；外部噪声源能够可靠地诱导反射性生成动态的相位转变；定量评估证实了人格保持的一致性以及模式间的显著差异(p < 0.01)。

Conclusion: LN-RP协议为研究大语言模型中的反射性生成、涌现行为和长程语言一致性提供了可重复的方法，揭示了噪声驱动的人格涌现机制和相位转变现象。

Abstract: This paper introduces the Luca-Noise Reflex Protocol (LN-RP), a computational framework for analyzing noise-driven persona emergence in large language models. By injecting stochastic noise seeds into the initial generation state, we observe nonlinear transitions in linguistic behavior across 152 generation cycles. Our results reveal three stable persona modes with distinct entropy signatures, and demonstrate that external noise sources can reliably induce phase transitions in reflexive generation dynamics. Quantitative evaluation confirms consistent persona retention and significant differences across modes (p < 0.01). The protocol provides a reproducible method for studying reflexive generation, emergent behavior, and longrange linguistic coherence in LLMs.

TL;DR: HarmTransform：一种多智能体辩论框架，通过系统性地将有害查询转化为更隐蔽的形式来增强LLM安全对齐，同时保留其恶意意图


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前LLM安全机制主要关注明显的有害内容，但用户可以通过隐蔽的改写方式伪装恶意意图，而现有安全训练数据存在显著缺口

Method: 引入HarmTransform多智能体辩论框架，利用多个智能体之间的迭代批评和精炼，系统地将有害查询转化为更隐蔽的形式

Result: 实验表明HarmTransform在生成有效查询转换方面显著优于标准基线；分析显示辩论具有双刃剑效应：既能提升隐蔽性，也可能引入主题偏移和不必要的复杂性

Conclusion: 多智能体辩论在生成全面安全训练数据方面既有潜力也有局限性，为未来LLM安全对齐提供了新的改进方向

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are equipped with safety mechanisms to detect and block harmful queries, yet current alignment approaches primarily focus on overtly dangerous content and overlook more subtle threats. However, users can often disguise harmful intent through covert rephrasing that preserves malicious objectives while appearing benign, which creates a significant gap in existing safety training data. To address this limitation, we introduce HarmTransform, a multi-agent debate framework for systematically transforming harmful queries into stealthier forms while preserving their underlying harmful intent. Our framework leverages iterative critique and refinement among multiple agents to generate high-quality, covert harmful query transformations that can be used to improve future LLM safety alignment. Experiments demonstrate that HarmTransform significantly outperforms standard baselines in producing effective query transformations. At the same time, our analysis reveals that debate acts as a double-edged sword: while it can sharpen transformations and improve stealth, it may also introduce topic shifts and unnecessary complexity. These insights highlight both the promise and the limitations of multi-agent debate for generating comprehensive safety training data.

TL;DR: LLMs在完美信息游戏中已展现出涌现的世界模型能力，本文将其扩展到不完全信息领域，以德州扑克为典型POMDP进行研究，发现模型能从扑克手牌历史数据中学习确定性和随机性特征。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 扩展LLMs在完美信息游戏中涌现世界模型的研究到不完全信息领域，探索在部分可观察马尔可夫决策过程（POMDP）中LLMs能否学习环境表示，以德州扑克作为典型不完全信息游戏进行研究。

Method: 在扑克手牌历史数据上预训练GPT风格模型，通过探测内部激活来分析模型表示，主要使用非线性探针来解码模型学习到的特征。

Result: 模型在没有明确指导的情况下学习了确定性结构（如手牌等级）和随机性特征（如权益），这些表示可解码且与理论信念状态相关，表明LLMs学习了德州扑克随机环境的自身表示。

Conclusion: LLMs能够在部分可观察环境中学习环境的内部表示，包括确定性和随机性特征，这为理解LLMs在不完全信息决策过程中的能力提供了新见解。

Abstract: Transformer-based large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated strong reasoning abilities across diverse fields, from solving programming challenges to competing in strategy-intensive games such as chess. Prior work has shown that LLMs can develop emergent world models in games of perfect information, where internal representations correspond to latent states of the environment. In this paper, we extend this line of investigation to domains of incomplete information, focusing on poker as a canonical partially observable Markov decision process (POMDP). We pretrain a GPT-style model on Poker Hand History (PHH) data and probe its internal activations. Our results demonstrate that the model learns both deterministic structure, such as hand ranks, and stochastic features, such as equity, without explicit instruction. Furthermore, by using primarily nonlinear probes, we demonstrated that these representations are decodeable and correlate with theoretical belief states, suggesting that LLMs are learning their own representation of the stochastic environment of Texas Hold'em Poker.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出一个两阶段框架，通过针对性训练和选择性推理处理性别歧视内容检测中的数据稀缺、噪声和概念模糊问题


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在线性别歧视内容日益呈现微妙、依赖上下文的形态，传统检测方法难以应对。这些内容涉及语言、心理、法律和文化等多维度重叠，导致标注数据中存在混合甚至矛盾信号，加上标签稀缺和类别不平衡，造成决策边界不稳定，使微调模型忽略更微妙、代表性不足的危害形式

Method: 提出两阶段框架：1) 训练阶段使用类别平衡焦点损失、类别感知批处理和事后阈值校准来缓解标签不平衡和噪声监督；2) 推理阶段采用动态路由机制，高置信度案例直接分类，不确定实例则升级到"协作专家判断"模块，该模块提示多个人格并通过法官模型整合其推理

Result: 在多个基准测试中取得最先进结果：EXIST 2025 Task 1.1上F1分数提升+2.72%，EDOS Tasks A和B分别获得+4.48%和+1.30%的增益

Conclusion: 该框架通过统一针对性训练程序和选择性推理机制，有效解决了性别歧视内容检测中的数据稀缺、噪声和概念模糊等挑战，显著提升了检测性能

Abstract: Sexist content online increasingly appears in subtle, context-dependent forms that evade traditional detection methods. Its interpretation often depends on overlapping linguistic, psychological, legal, and cultural dimensions, which produce mixed and sometimes contradictory signals, even in annotated datasets. These inconsistencies, combined with label scarcity and class imbalance, result in unstable decision boundaries and cause fine-tuned models to overlook subtler, underrepresented forms of harm. Together, these limitations point to the need for a design that explicitly addresses the combined effects of (i) underrepresentation, (ii) noise, and (iii) conceptual ambiguity in both data and model predictions. To address these challenges, we propose a two-stage framework that unifies (i) targeted training procedures to adapt supervision to scarce and noisy data with (ii) selective, reasoning-based inference to handle ambiguous or borderline cases. Our training setup applies class-balanced focal loss, class-aware batching, and post-hoc threshold calibration to mitigate label imbalance and noisy supervision. At inference time, a dynamic routing mechanism classifies high-confidence cases directly and escalates uncertain instances to a novel \textit{Collaborative Expert Judgment} (CEJ) module, which prompts multiple personas and consolidates their reasoning through a judge model. Our approach achieves state-of-the-art results across several benchmarks, with a +2.72\% improvement in F1 on the EXIST 2025 Task 1.1, and a gains of +4.48\% and +1.30\% on the EDOS Tasks A and B, respectively.

*Tiancheng Su,Meicong Zhang,Guoxiu He*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: EASD是一种无需训练的方法，通过动态熵惩罚机制改进推测解码，使目标LLM在某些情况下能超越自身固有性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统推测解码中草稿模型与目标模型过度对齐，限制了性能只能达到目标LLM的水平。需要一种方法既能保持效率，又可能超越目标模型性能。

Method: 在标准推测解码基础上，引入基于熵的动态惩罚机制。在每个解码步骤，利用采样分布的熵量化模型不确定性。当两个模型都呈现高熵且top-N预测有显著重叠时，拒绝对应token并由目标LLM重新采样。

Result: 在多个推理基准测试中，EASD始终优于现有推测解码方法，在大多数情况下甚至超越了目标LLM本身的性能。同时证明EASD的效率与标准推测解码相当。

Conclusion: EASD通过熵感知机制和草稿模型验证，不仅保持了推测解码的效率优势，还实现了超越目标模型固有性能的可能性，为LLM推理加速提供了新思路。

Abstract: Speculative decoding (SD) accelerates large language model (LLM) reasoning by using a small draft model to generate candidate tokens, which the target LLM either accepts directly or regenerates upon rejection. However, excessive alignment between the draft and target models constrains SD to the performance of the target LLM. To address this limitation, we propose Entropy-Aware Speculative Decoding (EASD), a training-free enhancement. Building on standard SD, EASD incorporates a dynamic entropy-based penalty. At each decoding step, we employ the entropy of the sampling distribution to quantify model uncertainty. When both models exhibit high entropy with substantial overlap among their top-N predictions, the corresponding token is rejected and re-sampled by the target LLM. This penalty prevents low-confidence errors from propagating. By incorporating draft-model verification, EASD enables the possibility of surpassing the target model's inherent performance. Experiments across multiple reasoning benchmarks demonstrate that EASD consistently outperforms existing SD methods and, in most cases, surpasses the target LLM itself. We further prove that the efficiency of EASD is comparable to that of SD. The code can be found in the Supplementary Materials.

Motivation: 现有音频语言模型通常需要任务特定的微调来完成特定音频任务，而人类能够通过少量示例或简单指令泛化到新的音频任务。研究者认为GPT-3展示的通过扩展下一个标记预测预训练实现强泛化能力的范式同样适用于音频领域。

Method: 将MiMo-Audio的预训练数据扩展到超过1亿小时，观察到少样本学习能力的涌现。在后期训练阶段，策划了多样化的指令调优语料库，并在音频理解和生成中引入了思考机制。

Result: MiMo-Audio-7B-Base在语音智能和音频理解基准测试中达到开源SOTA性能，能够泛化到训练数据中未包含的任务（如语音转换、风格迁移、语音编辑），并展现出强大的语音延续能力。MiMo-Audio-7B-Instruct在音频理解基准、口语对话基准和指令TTS评估中达到开源SOTA，接近或超越闭源模型。

Conclusion: 通过大规模扩展音频预训练数据，可以实现类似GPT-3在文本领域的泛化能力，使音频模型具备少样本学习和任务泛化能力，为通用音频智能系统的发展提供了重要方向。

Abstract: Existing audio language models typically rely on task-specific fine-tuning to accomplish particular audio tasks. In contrast, humans are able to generalize to new audio tasks with only a few examples or simple instructions. GPT-3 has shown that scaling next-token prediction pretraining enables strong generalization capabilities in text, and we believe this paradigm is equally applicable to the audio domain. By scaling MiMo-Audio's pretraining data to over one hundred million of hours, we observe the emergence of few-shot learning capabilities across a diverse set of audio tasks. We develop a systematic evaluation of these capabilities and find that MiMo-Audio-7B-Base achieves SOTA performance on both speech intelligence and audio understanding benchmarks among open-source models. Beyond standard metrics, MiMo-Audio-7B-Base generalizes to tasks absent from its training data, such as voice conversion, style transfer, and speech editing. MiMo-Audio-7B-Base also demonstrates powerful speech continuation capabilities, capable of generating highly realistic talk shows, recitations, livestreaming and debates. At the post-training stage, we curate a diverse instruction-tuning corpus and introduce thinking mechanisms into both audio understanding and generation. MiMo-Audio-7B-Instruct achieves open-source SOTA on audio understanding benchmarks (MMSU, MMAU, MMAR, MMAU-Pro), spoken dialogue benchmarks (Big Bench Audio, MultiChallenge Audio) and instruct-TTS evaluations, approaching or surpassing closed-source models.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 新闻文本中的自动偏见检测被广泛用于支持新闻分析和媒体问责，但人们对偏见检测模型如何做出决策或为何失败知之甚少，需要理解不同模型架构如何操作化语言偏见。

Method: 采用比较可解释性研究方法，分析两种基于Transformer的偏见检测模型：在BABE数据集上微调的偏见检测器模型和在BABE数据集上微调的领域自适应预训练RoBERTa模型。使用SHAP解释分析词级归因，比较正确和错误预测中的归因模式。

Result: 两种模型虽然关注相似的评价语言类别，但在信号整合方式上差异显著。偏见检测器模型对假阳性赋予比真阳性更强的内部证据，导致系统性地过度标记中性新闻内容。领域自适应模型的归因模式与预测结果更一致，假阳性减少63%。模型错误源于不同的语言机制，假阳性由话语层面的模糊性而非明确的偏见线索驱动。

Conclusion: 偏见检测系统的可解释性评估至关重要，架构和训练选择对模型可靠性和新闻背景下的部署适用性具有关键影响。领域自适应方法能更好地对齐归因模式与预测结果，减少误报。

Abstract: Automated bias detection in news text is heavily used to support journalistic analysis and media accountability, yet little is known about how bias detection models arrive at their decisions or why they fail. In this work, we present a comparative interpretability study of two transformer-based bias detection models: a bias detector fine-tuned on the BABE dataset and a domain-adapted pre-trained RoBERTa model fine-tuned on the BABE dataset, using SHAP-based explanations. We analyze word-level attributions across correct and incorrect predictions to characterize how different model architectures operationalize linguistic bias. Our results show that although both models attend to similar categories of evaluative language, they differ substantially in how these signals are integrated into predictions. The bias detector model assigns stronger internal evidence to false positives than to true positives, indicating a misalignment between attribution strength and prediction correctness and contributing to systematic over-flagging of neutral journalistic content. In contrast, the domain-adaptive model exhibits attribution patterns that better align with prediction outcomes and produces 63\% fewer false positives. We further demonstrate that model errors arise from distinct linguistic mechanisms, with false positives driven by discourse-level ambiguity rather than explicit bias cues. These findings highlight the importance of interpretability-aware evaluation for bias detection systems and suggest that architectural and training choices critically affect both model reliability and deployment suitability in journalistic contexts.

TL;DR: 该论文研究在检索增强问答中使用LLMs时，长上下文窗口带来的信息过载问题，提出了一种自适应分块提示策略来平衡相关信息获取与无关信息过滤。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着LLMs上下文窗口的扩展，检索增强生成中广泛使用更长的上下文。虽然更长的上下文更容易包含目标知识，但也引入了更多无关信息，这会阻碍模型的生成过程并降低其性能。

Method: 设计了一种自适应提示策略：将检索到的信息分割成较小的块，并顺序提示LLM使用每个块来回答问题。通过调整块大小，可以在纳入相关信息和减少无关信息之间进行权衡。

Result: 在三个开放域问答数据集上的实验结果表明，自适应策略在使用更少token的情况下，达到了标准提示的性能水平。分析发现，当遇到信息不足时，LLM经常生成错误答案而不是拒绝回答，这是主要的错误来源。

Conclusion: 该研究强调了需要进一步研究增强LLMs在面对信息不足时有效拒绝请求的能力，同时提出的自适应分块策略为解决长上下文带来的信息过载问题提供了有效方法。

Abstract: The success of expanded context windows in Large Language Models (LLMs) has driven increased use of broader context in retrieval-augmented generation. We investigate the use of LLMs for retrieval augmented question answering. While longer contexts make it easier to incorporate targeted knowledge, they introduce more irrelevant information that hinders the model's generation process and degrades its performance. To address the issue, we design an adaptive prompting strategy which involves splitting the retrieved information into smaller chunks and sequentially prompting a LLM to answer the question using each chunk. Adjusting the chunk size allows a trade-off between incorporating relevant information and reducing irrelevant information. Experimental results on three open-domain question answering datasets demonstrate that the adaptive strategy matches the performance of standard prompting while using fewer tokens. Our analysis reveals that when encountering insufficient information, the LLM often generates incorrect answers instead of declining to respond, which constitutes a major source of error. This finding highlights the need for further research into enhancing LLMs' ability to effectively decline requests when faced with inadequate information.

Motivation: 基于机制可解释性研究发现中间注意力层编码token级假设并迭代优化，探索利用注意力层token分布生成对抗样本的可能性，以测试LLM评估流程的鲁棒性

Method: 从中间注意力层提取token分布作为对抗扰动，与基于提示或梯度的攻击方法不同，利用模型内部token预测生成语义合理且内部一致的扰动，在ArgQuality数据集上进行论证质量评估实验，使用LLaMA-3.1-Instruct-8B同时作为生成器和评估器

Result: 注意力层生成的对抗样本能显著降低评估性能，同时保持与原始输入的语义相似性；但某些层和token位置的替换会导致语法退化，限制了实际有效性

Conclusion: 中间层表示作为对抗样本来源具有潜力，但当前存在语法退化等限制，为压力测试LLM评估流程提供了原则性方法，但需进一步改进

Abstract: Recent advances in mechanistic interpretability suggest that intermediate attention layers encode token-level hypotheses that are iteratively refined toward the final output. In this work, we exploit this property to generate adversarial examples directly from attention-layer token distributions. Unlike prompt-based or gradient-based attacks, our approach leverages model-internal token predictions, producing perturbations that are both plausible and internally consistent with the model's own generation process. We evaluate whether tokens extracted from intermediate layers can serve as effective adversarial perturbations for downstream evaluation tasks. We conduct experiments on argument quality assessment using the ArgQuality dataset, with LLaMA-3.1-Instruct-8B serving as both the generator and evaluator. Our results show that attention-based adversarial examples lead to measurable drops in evaluation performance while remaining semantically similar to the original inputs. However, we also observe that substitutions drawn from certain layers and token positions can introduce grammatical degradation, limiting their practical effectiveness. Overall, our findings highlight both the promise and current limitations of using intermediate-layer representations as a principled source of adversarial examples for stress-testing LLM-based evaluation pipelines.

Abstract: This research project addresses the errors of financial numerical reasoning Question Answering (QA) tasks due to the lack of domain knowledge in finance. Despite recent advances in Large Language Models (LLMs), financial numerical questions remain challenging because they require specific domain knowledge in finance and complex multi-step numeric reasoning. We implement a multi-retriever Retrieval Augmented Generators (RAG) system to retrieve both external domain knowledge and internal question contexts, and utilize the latest LLM to tackle these tasks. Through comprehensive ablation experiments and error analysis, we find that domain-specific training with the SecBERT encoder significantly contributes to our best neural symbolic model surpassing the FinQA paper's top model, which serves as our baseline. This suggests the potential superior performance of domain-specific training. Furthermore, our best prompt-based LLM generator achieves the state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance with significant improvement (>7%), yet it is still below the human expert performance. This study highlights the trade-off between hallucinations loss and external knowledge gains in smaller models and few-shot examples. For larger models, the gains from external facts typically outweigh the hallucination loss. Finally, our findings confirm the enhanced numerical reasoning capabilities of the latest LLM, optimized for few-shot learning.

*Conrad Borchers,Manit Patel,Seiyon M. Lee,Anthony F. Botelho*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种分析框架，将学生回答内容信号与教师评分倾向分离，通过建模教师历史作为动态先验，结合文本嵌入表征，量化各信号贡献并可视化模型分歧，用于反思评分实践与学生学习证据的一致性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 开放性问题回答是学习的核心，但自动评分常常混淆学生回答内容与教师评分倾向。现有方法缺乏对评分者偏好的显式建模，难以区分内容质量与评分者习惯的影响。

Method: 提出分析优先框架：1) 将教师评分历史建模为动态先验；2) 使用句子嵌入获取文本表征；3) 采用中心化和残差化处理缓解提示和教师混杂因素；4) 时间验证的线性模型量化各信号贡献；5) 投影方法可视化模型分歧供定性检查。

Result: 教师先验对评分预测影响显著：先验+内容嵌入组合模型表现最佳(AUC~0.815)，纯内容模型虽高于随机但显著较弱(AUC~0.626)。调整评分者效应能锐化残差内容表征，保留更多信息维度，揭示语义证据支持理解而非表面回答差异的情况。

Conclusion: 该框架将嵌入特征转化为学习分析工具，使教师和研究者能够审查评分实践与学生推理证据的一致性，为反思和改进评分实践提供实用管道。

Abstract: Open-ended responses are central to learning, yet automated scoring often conflates what students wrote with how teachers grade. We present an analytics-first framework that separates content signals from rater tendencies, making judgments visible and auditable via analytics. Using de-identified ASSISTments mathematics responses, we model teacher histories as dynamic priors and derive text representations from sentence embeddings, incorporating centering and residualization to mitigate prompt and teacher confounds. Temporally-validated linear models quantify the contributions of each signal, and a projection surfaces model disagreements for qualitative inspection. Results show that teacher priors heavily influence grade predictions; the strongest results arise when priors are combined with content embeddings (AUC~0.815), while content-only models remain above chance but substantially weaker (AUC~0.626). Adjusting for rater effects sharpens the residual content representation, retaining more informative embedding dimensions and revealing cases where semantic evidence supports understanding as opposed to surface-level differences in how students respond. The contribution presents a practical pipeline that transforms embeddings from mere features into learning analytics for reflection, enabling teachers and researchers to examine where grading practices align (or conflict) with evidence of student reasoning and learning.

TL;DR: HGMem提出了一种基于超图的记忆机制，用于增强多步检索增强生成(RAG)中的全局理解和复杂推理能力，通过动态超图结构捕获事实间的高阶关联。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有RAG系统中的记忆模块主要作为被动存储，仅积累孤立事实用于输入压缩和子查询生成。这种静态设计忽略了原始事实间的高阶关联，而这些关联组合能为后续步骤提供更强指导，导致表示能力有限、推理碎片化、全局理解能力弱。

Method: 提出HGMem，一种基于超图的记忆机制。将记忆表示为超图，其中超边对应不同的记忆单元，能够在记忆中逐步形成高阶交互。该机制围绕焦点问题连接事实和思考，演变为集成的情境化知识结构，为后续步骤的深度推理提供强命题。

Result: 在多个为全局理解设计的挑战性数据集上进行评估。大量实验和深入分析表明，该方法持续改进多步RAG性能，并在多样化任务中显著优于强基线系统。

Conclusion: HGMem将记忆概念从简单存储扩展到动态、表达性强的结构，用于复杂推理和全局理解。超图记忆机制通过捕获高阶关联，解决了现有RAG系统中推理碎片化和全局理解能力弱的问题。

Abstract: Multi-step retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) has become a widely adopted strategy for enhancing large language models (LLMs) on tasks that demand global comprehension and intensive reasoning. Many RAG systems incorporate a working memory module to consolidate retrieved information. However, existing memory designs function primarily as passive storage that accumulates isolated facts for the purpose of condensing the lengthy inputs and generating new sub-queries through deduction. This static nature overlooks the crucial high-order correlations among primitive facts, the compositions of which can often provide stronger guidance for subsequent steps. Therefore, their representational strength and impact on multi-step reasoning and knowledge evolution are limited, resulting in fragmented reasoning and weak global sense-making capacity in extended contexts. We introduce HGMem, a hypergraph-based memory mechanism that extends the concept of memory beyond simple storage into a dynamic, expressive structure for complex reasoning and global understanding. In our approach, memory is represented as a hypergraph whose hyperedges correspond to distinct memory units, enabling the progressive formation of higher-order interactions within memory. This mechanism connects facts and thoughts around the focal problem, evolving into an integrated and situated knowledge structure that provides strong propositions for deeper reasoning in subsequent steps. We evaluate HGMem on several challenging datasets designed for global sense-making. Extensive experiments and in-depth analyses show that our method consistently improves multi-step RAG and substantially outperforms strong baseline systems across diverse tasks.

Conclusion: LoZA是一种有效的稀疏注意力方案，可在有限计算预算下显著提升长上下文处理效率，为长时推理和智能体应用提供可行的技术路径

Abstract: We introduce LongCat ZigZag Attention (LoZA), which is a sparse attention scheme designed to transform any existing full-attention models into sparse versions with rather limited compute budget. In long-context scenarios, LoZA can achieve significant speed-ups both for prefill-intensive (e.g., retrieval-augmented generation) and decode-intensive (e.g., tool-integrated reasoning) cases. Specifically, by applying LoZA to LongCat-Flash during mid-training, we serve LongCat-Flash-Exp as a long-context foundation model that can swiftly process up to 1 million tokens, enabling efficient long-term reasoning and long-horizon agentic capabilities.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的大语言模型和监督方法在中文拼写校正中存在两个主要问题：1) 对新型错误的鲁棒性不足；2) 依赖昂贵的标注数据。需要一种无需标注的鲁棒解决方案。

Method: CEC-Zero采用零监督强化学习框架：1) 从干净文本合成错误输入；2) 通过语义相似度和候选一致性计算聚类共识奖励；3) 使用PPO算法优化策略。该方法具有无偏奖励和收敛的理论保证。

Result: 在9个基准测试中，CEC-Zero比监督基线方法高出10-13个F1分数点，比强LLM微调方法高出5-8个F1分数点，表现出卓越性能。

Conclusion: CEC-Zero建立了一个无需标签的范式，用于鲁棒、可扩展的中文拼写校正，释放了LLM在噪声文本处理管道中的潜力。

Abstract: Large-scale Chinese spelling correction (CSC) remains critical for real-world text processing, yet existing LLMs and supervised methods lack robustness to novel errors and rely on costly annotations. We introduce CEC-Zero, a zero-supervision reinforcement learning framework that addresses this by enabling LLMs to correct their own mistakes. CEC-Zero synthesizes errorful inputs from clean text, computes cluster-consensus rewards via semantic similarity and candidate agreement, and optimizes the policy with PPO. It outperforms supervised baselines by 10--13 F$_1$ points and strong LLM fine-tunes by 5--8 points across 9 benchmarks, with theoretical guarantees of unbiased rewards and convergence. CEC-Zero establishes a label-free paradigm for robust, scalable CSC, unlocking LLM potential in noisy text pipelines.

<details>

Motivation: 现有方法依赖人工定义的概念在词级别分析推理过程，但无法捕捉完整的推理行为谱系，许多行为难以在词空间中定义

Method: 提出RISE框架，将思维链轨迹分割为句子级"步骤"，在步骤级激活上训练稀疏自编码器，发现编码不同推理行为的推理向量

Conclusion: 无监督潜在发现方法在解释和可控引导LLM推理方面具有潜力，为理解模型内部推理机制提供了新途径

Abstract: Despite the growing reasoning capabilities of recent large language models (LLMs), their internal mechanisms during the reasoning process remain underexplored. Prior approaches often rely on human-defined concepts (e.g., overthinking, reflection) at the word level to analyze reasoning in a supervised manner. However, such methods are limited, as it is infeasible to capture the full spectrum of potential reasoning behaviors, many of which are difficult to define in token space. In this work, we propose an unsupervised framework (namely, RISE: Reasoning behavior Interpretability via Sparse auto-Encoder) for discovering reasoning vectors, which we define as directions in the activation space that encode distinct reasoning behaviors. By segmenting chain-of-thought traces into sentence-level 'steps' and training sparse auto-encoders (SAEs) on step-level activations, we uncover disentangled features corresponding to interpretable behaviors such as reflection and backtracking. Visualization and clustering analyses show that these behaviors occupy separable regions in the decoder column space. Moreover, targeted interventions on SAE-derived vectors can controllably amplify or suppress specific reasoning behaviors, altering inference trajectories without retraining. Beyond behavior-specific disentanglement, SAEs capture structural properties such as response length, revealing clusters of long versus short reasoning traces. More interestingly, SAEs enable the discovery of novel behaviors beyond human supervision. We demonstrate the ability to control response confidence by identifying confidence-related vectors in the SAE decoder space. These findings underscore the potential of unsupervised latent discovery for both interpreting and controllably steering reasoning in LLMs.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 区分假新闻与讽刺/幽默内容具有独特挑战，因为两者具有重叠的语言特征但意图不同。需要开发有效的检测框架，特别是在资源受限的实际部署环境中。

Abstract: Distinguishing fake or untrue news from satire or humor poses a unique challenge due to their overlapping linguistic features and divergent intent. This study develops WISE (Web Information Satire and Fakeness Evaluation) framework which benchmarks eight lightweight transformer models alongside two baseline models on a balanced dataset of 20,000 samples from Fakeddit, annotated as either fake news or satire. Using stratified 5-fold cross-validation, we evaluate models across comprehensive metrics including accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, ROC-AUC, PR-AUC, MCC, Brier score, and Expected Calibration Error. Our evaluation reveals that MiniLM, a lightweight model, achieves the highest accuracy (87.58%) among all models, while RoBERTa-base achieves the highest ROC-AUC (95.42%) and strong accuracy (87.36%). DistilBERT offers an excellent efficiency-accuracy trade-off with 86.28\% accuracy and 93.90\% ROC-AUC. Statistical tests confirm significant performance differences between models, with paired t-tests and McNemar tests providing rigorous comparisons. Our findings highlight that lightweight models can match or exceed baseline performance, offering actionable insights for deploying misinformation detection systems in real-world, resource-constrained settings.

TL;DR: iCLP框架让大语言模型在潜在空间进行隐式规划，在语言空间进行推理，显著提升数学推理和代码生成任务的准确性和效率，同时保持可解释性


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于显式文本规划的方法面临两个主要挑战：LLM幻觉导致规划不准确，以及任务特定问题的高度多样性使得生成有效规划困难。受人类内隐认知启发，需要开发更紧凑、泛化的规划方法

Method: iCLP框架包含三个步骤：1) 从现有逐步推理轨迹中蒸馏显式规划；2) 通过向量量化自编码器和码本学习这些规划的离散表示；3) 在配对潜在规划和相应推理步骤上微调LLMs，使模型学会在推理过程中进行隐式规划

Result: 实验结果表明，iCLP使LLMs能够在潜在空间规划同时在语言空间推理，在数学推理和代码生成任务上显著提高了准确性和效率，并展现出强大的跨领域泛化能力，同时保持了思维链推理的可解释性

Conclusion: iCLP框架成功地将人类内隐认知原理应用于LLM规划，通过潜在规划实现了更高效、准确且可泛化的推理，为LLM的隐式规划能力提供了有效解决方案

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs), when guided by explicit textual plans, can perform reliable step-by-step reasoning during problem-solving. However, generating accurate and effective textual plans remains challenging due to LLM hallucinations and the high diversity of task-specific questions. To address this, we draw inspiration from human Implicit Cognition (IC), the subconscious process by which decisions are guided by compact, generalized patterns learned from past experiences without requiring explicit verbalization. We propose iCLP, a novel framework that enables LLMs to adaptively generate latent plans (LPs), which are compact encodings of effective reasoning instructions. iCLP first distills explicit plans from existing step-by-step reasoning trajectories. It then learns discrete representations of these plans via a vector-quantized autoencoder coupled with a codebook. Finally, by fine-tuning LLMs on paired latent plans and corresponding reasoning steps, the models learn to perform implicit planning during reasoning. Experimental results on mathematical reasoning and code generation tasks demonstrate that, with iCLP, LLMs can plan in latent space while reasoning in language space. This approach yields significant improvements in both accuracy and efficiency and, crucially, demonstrates strong cross-domain generalization while preserving the interpretability of chain-of-thought reasoning.

Motivation: LLM在医疗、法律、金融等决策关键领域应用日益广泛，但其可靠性仍不确定。现有模型存在过度自信错误、输入偏移下性能下降、缺乏清晰不确定性估计等问题，且现有评估方法零散，仅关注孤立方面。

Method: 引入Composite Reliability Score (CRS)统一框架，整合校准、鲁棒性和不确定性量化三个维度。在5个QA数据集上对10个领先开源LLM进行实验，评估基线性能、扰动影响和校准方法。

Result: CRS提供稳定的模型排名，揭示单一指标遗漏的隐藏失效模式，表明最可靠的系统在准确性、鲁棒性和校准不确定性之间取得平衡。

Conclusion: CRS框架为LLM可靠性评估提供统一标准，有助于识别在决策关键应用中表现最可靠的模型，强调平衡多方面性能的重要性。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) like LLaMA, Mistral, and Gemma are increasingly used in decision-critical domains such as healthcare, law, and finance, yet their reliability remains uncertain. They often make overconfident errors, degrade under input shifts, and lack clear uncertainty estimates. Existing evaluations are fragmented, addressing only isolated aspects. We introduce the Composite Reliability Score (CRS), a unified framework that integrates calibration, robustness, and uncertainty quantification into a single interpretable metric. Through experiments on ten leading open-source LLMs across five QA datasets, we assess performance under baselines, perturbations, and calibration methods. CRS delivers stable model rankings, uncovers hidden failure modes missed by single metrics, and highlights that the most dependable systems balance accuracy, robustness, and calibrated uncertainty.

Beyond standard translation, the HY-MT1.5 series supports advanced constraints, including terminology intervention, context-aware translation, and format preservation. Extensive empirical evaluations confirm that both models offer highly competitive, robust solutions for general and specialized translation tasks within their respective parameter scales.

Motivation: 掩码扩散语言模型（MDLMs）通过迭代去噪过程生成文本，具有掩码并行解码优势，性能可与自回归大语言模型竞争。然而，MDLMs在推理时控制和引导的有效机制尚未得到充分探索

Abstract: Masked diffusion language models (MDLMs) generate text through an iterative denoising process. They have recently gained attention due to mask-parallel decoding and competitive performance with autoregressive large language models. However, effective mechanisms for inference-time control and steering in MDLMs remain largely unexplored. We present an activation-steering framework for MDLMs that computes layer-wise steering vectors from a single forward pass using contrastive examples, without simulating the denoising trajectory. These directions are applied at every reverse-diffusion step, yielding an efficient inference-time control mechanism. Experiments on LLaDA-8B-Instruct demonstrate reliable modulation of high-level attributes, with ablations examining the effects of steering across transformer sub-modules and token scope (prompt vs.\ response).

Motivation: 现有的大型语言模型主要关注物理世界的规律建模，缺乏对情感因素的系统探索。情感作为世界知识的关键组成部分，对人类决策有重要影响。作者通过实验证明，移除情感相关信息会降低推理性能，因此需要将情感因素整合到世界模型中。

Method: 提出大型情感世界模型（LEWM），首先构建了Emotion-Why-How（EWH）数据集，将情感整合到因果关系中，支持推理行为原因和情感如何驱动未来世界状态。基于该数据集，LEWM显式建模情感状态、视觉观察和动作，使世界模型能够预测未来状态和情感转变。

Conclusion: 该研究证明了将情感因素整合到世界模型中的重要性，提出的LEWM能够更好地理解和预测情感驱动的社会行为，为构建更全面的世界模型提供了新思路。

Abstract: World Models serve as tools for understanding the current state of the world and predicting its future dynamics, with broad application potential across numerous fields. As a key component of world knowledge, emotion significantly influences human decision-making. While existing Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown preliminary capability in capturing world knowledge, they primarily focus on modeling physical-world regularities and lack systematic exploration of emotional factors. In this paper, we first demonstrate the importance of emotion in understanding the world by showing that removing emotionally relevant information degrades reasoning performance. Inspired by theory of mind, we further propose a Large Emotional World Model (LEWM). Specifically, we construct the Emotion-Why-How (EWH) dataset, which integrates emotion into causal relationships and enables reasoning about why actions occur and how emotions drive future world states. Based on this dataset, LEWM explicitly models emotional states alongside visual observations and actions, allowing the world model to predict both future states and emotional transitions. Experimental results show that LEWM more accurately predicts emotion-driven social behaviors while maintaining comparable performance to general world models on basic tasks.

Additionally, we present methodological approaches to cluster-level optimizations, addressing host- and device-bound bottlenecks during large-scale training tasks. These infrastructure advancements yield significant throughput improvements and near-linear scaling on clusters comprising thousands of devices, providing a robust foundation for large-scale language model development on hardware ecosystems.

Motivation: 当前大型语言模型在临床诊断中存在三个关键局限：1) 由于缺乏已验证知识基础而生成幻觉医学内容；2) 提出冗余或低效问题而非有助于诊断进展的区分性问题；3) 在多轮对话中失去连贯性，导致矛盾或不一致的结论。需要开发能够模拟真实临床场景中迭代、假设驱动推理的诊断框架。

Method: MedKGI框架整合医学知识图谱以将推理约束在已验证的医学本体中，基于信息增益选择问题以最大化诊断效率，并采用OSCE格式的结构化状态来维护跨轮次的一致证据跟踪。

Result: 在临床基准测试中，MedKGI在诊断准确性和询问效率方面均优于强大的LLM基线，平均提高对话效率30%，同时保持最先进的准确性。

Conclusion: MedKGI通过将医学知识图谱与结构化推理相结合，有效解决了当前LLM在临床诊断中的关键局限性，实现了更准确、高效的诊断推理，为临床AI应用提供了有前景的解决方案。

Abstract: Recent advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated significant promise in clinical diagnosis. However, current models struggle to emulate the iterative, diagnostic hypothesis-driven reasoning of real clinical scenarios. Specifically, current LLMs suffer from three critical limitations: (1) generating hallucinated medical content due to weak grounding in verified knowledge, (2) asking redundant or inefficient questions rather than discriminative ones that hinder diagnostic progress, and (3) losing coherence over multi-turn dialogues, leading to contradictory or inconsistent conclusions. To address these challenges, we propose MedKGI, a diagnostic framework grounded in clinical practices. MedKGI integrates a medical knowledge graph (KG) to constrain reasoning to validated medical ontologies, selects questions based on information gain to maximize diagnostic efficiency, and adopts an OSCE-format structured state to maintain consistent evidence tracking across turns. Experiments on clinical benchmarks show that MedKGI outperforms strong LLM baselines in both diagnostic accuracy and inquiry efficiency, improving dialogue efficiency by 30% on average while maintaining state-of-the-art accuracy.

Motivation: 需要开发能够同时处理专利和科学文献的语言相似性模型，以准确预测专利与论文之间的引用关系，并探索不同司法管辖区引用行为的差异

Method: 基于SPECTER2模型在专利数据上进行微调得到Pat-SPECTER模型，通过马赛式评估比较8种语言相似性模型在预测可信专利-论文引用方面的性能，并在两个真实场景中验证模型能力

Result: Pat-SPECTER模型在预测专利-论文引用方面表现最佳，验证了美国专利因诚信义务（duty of candor）引用语义相似度较低论文的假设

Conclusion: 开发的Pat-SPECTER模型能有效处理专利和科学文献的相似性分析，为学术研究和实践应用提供了有价值的工具，并揭示了不同司法管辖区引用行为的差异

Abstract: We develop a language similarity model suitable for working with patents and scientific publications at the same time. In a horse race-style evaluation, we subject eight language (similarity) models to predict credible Patent-Paper Citations. We find that our Pat-SPECTER model performs best, which is the SPECTER2 model fine-tuned on patents. In two real-world scenarios (separating patent-paper-pairs and predicting patent-paper-pairs) we demonstrate the capabilities of the Pat-SPECTER. We finally test the hypothesis that US patents cite papers that are semantically less similar than in other large jurisdictions, which we posit is because of the duty of candor. The model is open for the academic community and practitioners alike.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: DATAMASK是一个用于大规模预训练数据选择的高效联合学习框架，通过将选择过程视为掩码学习问题，同时优化质量和多样性指标，在万亿级token数据集上实现高效选择。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有数据选择方法在万亿级token预训练数据集（如FineWeb和DCLM）上存在局限性：基于质量指标的选择在长期预训练中表现出严重的收益递减，而基于多样性指标的选择会移除太多高质量样本，两者都限制了预训练LLM的能力。由于计算成本高，这些指标很少在单一选择过程中联合考虑。

Method: DATAMASK将数据选择过程视为掩码学习问题，采用基于策略梯度的优化方法：迭代采样数据掩码，基于预定义目标计算策略梯度，更新掩码采样逻辑。框架包含多种加速增强，相比贪心算法减少98.9%的选择时间。

Result: 从15万亿token的FineWeb数据集中选择约10%的子集（FineWeb-Mask），在12个多样化任务上评估：1.5B密集模型提升3.2%，7B MoE模型提升1.9%。选择时间相比贪心算法减少98.9%，使万亿级token的联合学习研究成为可能。

Conclusion: DATAMASK框架能够高效地在万亿级token数据集上同时优化质量和多样性指标，解决了现有数据选择方法的局限性，显著提升了预训练模型性能，为大规模预训练数据选择提供了实用解决方案。

Abstract: A fine-grained data recipe is crucial for pre-training large language models, as it can significantly enhance training efficiency and model performance. One important ingredient in the recipe is to select samples based on scores produced by defined rules, LLM judgment, or statistical information in embeddings, which can be roughly categorized into quality and diversity metrics. Due to the high computational cost when applied to trillion-scale token pre-training datasets such as FineWeb and DCLM, these two or more types of metrics are rarely considered jointly in a single selection process. However, in our empirical study, selecting samples based on quality metrics exhibit severe diminishing returns during long-term pre-training, while selecting on diversity metrics removes too many valuable high-quality samples, both of which limit pre-trained LLMs' capabilities. Therefore, we introduce DATAMASK, a novel and efficient joint learning framework designed for large-scale pre-training data selection that can simultaneously optimize multiple types of metrics in a unified process, with this study focusing specifically on quality and diversity metrics. DATAMASK approaches the selection process as a mask learning problem, involving iterative sampling of data masks, computation of policy gradients based on predefined objectives with sampled masks, and updating of mask sampling logits. Through policy gradient-based optimization and various acceleration enhancements, it significantly reduces selection time by 98.9% compared to greedy algorithm, enabling our study to explore joint learning within trillion-scale tokens. With DATAMASK, we select a subset of about 10% from the 15 trillion-token FineWeb dataset, termed FineWeb-Mask. Evaluated across 12 diverse tasks, we achieves significant improvements of 3.2% on a 1.5B dense model and 1.9% on a 7B MoE model.

TL;DR: FIGR通过强化学习将主动视觉思维融入多轮推理，构建视觉表示来外化中间结构假设，在复杂数学推理任务上显著优于纯文本方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 复杂推理问题常涉及隐含的空间、几何和结构关系，这些关系在文本中未明确编码。纯文本推理难以捕捉复杂场景中的全局结构约束，需要新的方法来解决这一局限性。

Method: FIGR通过端到端强化学习将主动视觉思维整合到多轮推理中。系统在问题解决过程中构建视觉表示来外化中间结构假设，并自适应地调节何时以及如何进行视觉推理。

Result: 在具有挑战性的数学推理基准测试中，FIGR显著优于强大的纯文本思维链基线。具体而言，FIGR在AIME 2025上将基础模型提升了13.12%，在BeyondAIME上提升了11.00%。

Conclusion: 图形引导的多模态推理能有效增强复杂推理的稳定性和可靠性，通过视觉表示捕捉全局结构属性，为处理隐含空间和几何关系的推理问题提供了有前景的解决方案。

Abstract: Complex reasoning problems often involve implicit spatial, geometric, and structural relationships that are not explicitly encoded in text. While recent reasoning models have achieved strong performance across many domains, purely text-based reasoning struggles to represent global structural constraints in complex settings. In this paper, we introduce FIGR, which integrates active visual thinking into multi-turn reasoning via end-to-end reinforcement learning. FIGR externalizes intermediate structural hypotheses by constructing visual representations during problem solving. By adaptively regulating when and how visual reasoning should be invoked, FIGR enables more stable and coherent reasoning over global structural properties that are difficult to capture from text alone. Experiments on challenging mathematical reasoning benchmarks demonstrate that FIGR outperforms strong text-only chain-of-thought baselines. In particular, FIGR improves the base model by 13.12% on AIME 2025 and 11.00% on BeyondAIME, highlighting the effectiveness of figure-guided multimodal reasoning in enhancing the stability and reliability of complex reasoning.

TL;DR: 提出基于人类略读策略的自监督对比学习框架，通过随机掩码文档片段并使用NLI对比目标，增强长文档表示能力，在法医文本上实现精度与效率的双重提升。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有Transformer模型在词句级任务表现良好，但在法律、医学等领域的长文档表示上存在困难。稀疏注意力机制能处理长输入但资源消耗大且难以捕获完整文档上下文，分层Transformer效率较高但无法清晰解释文档不同部分间的关联。受人类略读策略启发，需要开发既能捕获重要信息又高效的长文档表示方法。

Method: 提出自监督对比学习框架：1）随机掩码文档的一个片段；2）使用基于自然语言推理(NLI)的对比目标，将被掩码片段与文档相关部分对齐，同时与不相关部分保持距离；3）模仿人类信息合成方式，生成更丰富且计算高效的文档表示。

Result: 在法律和生物医学文本上的实验验证了该方法在准确性和效率方面的显著提升，实现了精度与计算效率的双重改进。

Conclusion: 受人类略读策略启发的自监督对比学习框架能有效增强长文档表示，在保持计算效率的同时提升模型对法律和医学等专业领域长文档的理解能力，为长文档处理提供了新的解决方案。

Abstract: Although transformer-based models have shown strong performance in word- and sentence-level tasks, effectively representing long documents, especially in fields like law and medicine, remains difficult. Sparse attention mechanisms can handle longer inputs, but are resource-intensive and often fail to capture full-document context. Hierarchical transformer models offer better efficiency but do not clearly explain how they relate different sections of a document. In contrast, humans often skim texts, focusing on important sections to understand the overall message. Drawing from this human strategy, we introduce a new self-supervised contrastive learning framework that enhances long document representation. Our method randomly masks a section of the document and uses a natural language inference (NLI)-based contrastive objective to align it with relevant parts while distancing it from unrelated ones. This mimics how humans synthesize information, resulting in representations that are both richer and more computationally efficient. Experiments on legal and biomedical texts confirm significant gains in both accuracy and efficiency.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 自动文本摘要在高资源语言（如英语）中已取得高性能，但对低资源语言的摘要研究相对较少。本研究旨在比较多种低资源语言文本摘要方法，探索不同策略的有效性

Method: 1) 零样本提示不同规模的LLM；2) 微调较小模型（如mT5），包含和不包含三种数据增强方法；3) 多语言迁移；4) LLM翻译管道方法（源语言→英语→摘要→翻译回源语言）。使用五种不同指标进行评估

Result: 1) 相似参数规模的LLM之间性能存在差异；2) 多语言微调的mT5基线在大多数指标上优于其他方法，包括零样本LLM性能；3) LLM作为评估器在低资源语言上可能不太可靠

Conclusion: 对于低资源语言文本摘要，多语言微调方法（如mT5）比零样本LLM方法更有效，且LLM评估在低资源语言场景下存在可靠性问题，需要更稳健的评估方法

Abstract: Automatic text summarization has achieved high performance in high-resourced languages like English, but comparatively less attention has been given to summarization in less-resourced languages. This work compares a variety of different approaches to summarization from zero-shot prompting of LLMs large and small to fine-tuning smaller models like mT5 with and without three data augmentation approaches and multilingual transfer. We also explore an LLM translation pipeline approach, translating from the source language to English, summarizing and translating back. Evaluating with five different metrics, we find that there is variation across LLMs in their performance across similar parameter sizes, that our multilingual fine-tuned mT5 baseline outperforms most other approaches including zero-shot LLM performance for most metrics, and that LLM as judge may be less reliable on less-resourced languages.

Motivation: 传统雅思备考方法缺乏针对雅思写作评分标准的个性化反馈，需要开发能够提供定制化指导的智能平台

Method: 采用设计研究(DBR)方法进行迭代开发：早期使用规则基础方法，后期采用DistilBERT变换器模型加回归头，平台架构分离对话指导和写作界面以降低认知负荷

Result: 规则基础方法存在中段压缩、低准确性和负R²等问题；DistilBERT模型显著改善性能(MAE=0.66，正R²)；自适应反馈使分数显著提高(平均+0.060分，p=0.011，Cohen's d=0.504)

Conclusion: 自动反馈功能最适合作为人工教学的补充，保守的表面修正比激进的结构干预更可靠；评估高分作文仍具挑战，未来需进行纵向研究并纳入官方考官验证

Abstract: This paper presents the design, development, and evaluation of a proposed revision platform assisting candidates for the International English Language Testing System (IELTS) writing exam. Traditional IELTS preparation methods lack personalised feedback, catered to the IELTS writing rubric. To address these shortcomings, the platform features an attractive user interface (UI), an Automated Essay Scoring system (AES), and targeted feedback tailored to candidates and the IELTS writing rubric. The platform architecture separates conversational guidance from a dedicated writing interface to reduce cognitive load and simulate exam conditions. Through iterative, Design-Based Research (DBR) cycles, the study progressed from rule-based to transformer-based with a regression head scoring, mounted with adaptive feedback.
  Early cycles (2-3) revealed fundamental limitations of rule-based approaches: mid-band compression, low accuracy, and negative $R^2$ values. DBR Cycle 4 implemented a DistilBERT transformer model with a regression head, yielding substantial improvements with MAE of 0.66 and positive $R^2$. This enabled Cycle 5's adaptive feedback implementation, which demonstrated statistically significant score improvements (mean +0.060 bands, p = 0.011, Cohen's d = 0.504), though effectiveness varied by revision strategy. Findings suggest automated feedback functions are most suited as a supplement to human instruction, with conservative surface-level corrections proving more reliable than aggressive structural interventions for IELTS preparation contexts. Challenges remain in assessing higher-band essays, and future work should incorporate longitudinal studies with real IELTS candidates and validation from official examiners.

TL;DR: 该论文提出将段落分割作为语音转录后处理的关键步骤，创建了首个语音段落分割基准数据集，并开发了基于约束解码的LLM方法和紧凑的MiniSeg模型，实现了段落和章节的联合预测。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 自动语音转录通常生成无结构的词流，降低了可读性和再利用价值。语音处理领域长期缺乏段落分割这一关键后处理步骤，同时文本分割领域也缺少鲁棒且自然的基准数据集。

Method: 1) 创建TEDPara（人工标注的TED演讲）和YTSegPara（带合成标签的YouTube视频）作为首个语音段落分割基准；2) 提出约束解码方法，让大语言模型在保持原始转录的同时插入段落分隔符；3) 开发紧凑的MiniSeg模型，并通过层次化扩展实现章节和段落的联合预测。

Result: 建立了首个语音段落分割标准化基准，提出的MiniSeg模型在准确率上达到state-of-the-art，其层次化扩展能以最小计算成本同时预测章节和段落，约束解码方法实现了忠实、句子对齐的评估。

Conclusion: 该研究填补了语音处理与文本分割交叉领域的空白，将段落分割确立为语音处理中标准化、实用的任务，为语音转录的结构化后处理提供了完整解决方案。

Abstract: Automatic speech transcripts are often delivered as unstructured word streams that impede readability and repurposing. We recast paragraph segmentation as the missing structuring step and fill three gaps at the intersection of speech processing and text segmentation. First, we establish TEDPara (human-annotated TED talks) and YTSegPara (YouTube videos with synthetic labels) as the first benchmarks for the paragraph segmentation task. The benchmarks focus on the underexplored speech domain, where paragraph segmentation has traditionally not been part of post-processing, while also contributing to the wider text segmentation field, which still lacks robust and naturalistic benchmarks. Second, we propose a constrained-decoding formulation that lets large language models insert paragraph breaks while preserving the original transcript, enabling faithful, sentence-aligned evaluation. Third, we show that a compact model (MiniSeg) attains state-of-the-art accuracy and, when extended hierarchically, jointly predicts chapters and paragraphs with minimal computational cost. Together, our resources and methods establish paragraph segmentation as a standardized, practical task in speech processing.

TL;DR: HaluNet是一个轻量级可训练的神经框架，通过整合多粒度令牌级不确定性来检测LLM幻觉，结合语义嵌入与概率置信度和分布不确定性，实现高效的单次幻觉检测。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLM在问答任务中表现出色但经常产生幻觉（事实错误或捏造内容）。现有方法通常只关注单一类型的不确定性，忽略了不同来源之间的互补性，特别是令牌级概率不确定性和内部语义表示传达的不确定性之间的互补关系。

Method: HaluNet采用多分支架构，自适应地融合模型已知信息与其输出中表达的不确定性。它整合多粒度令牌级不确定性，将语义嵌入与概率置信度和分布不确定性相结合，实现高效的单次幻觉检测。

Result: 在SQuAD、TriviaQA和Natural Questions数据集上的实验表明，HaluNet在检测性能方面表现强劲，计算效率优越，无论是否访问上下文都能有效工作，突显了其在基于LLM的QA系统中实时幻觉检测的潜力。

Conclusion: HaluNet通过整合互补的不确定性来源，提供了一种轻量级、可扩展的幻觉检测解决方案，适用于实时LLM问答系统，能够有效平衡检测性能和计算效率。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) excel at question answering (QA) but often generate hallucinations, including factual errors or fabricated content. Detecting hallucinations from internal uncertainty signals is attractive due to its scalability and independence from external resources. Existing methods often aim to accurately capture a single type of uncertainty while overlooking the complementarity among different sources, particularly between token-level probability uncertainty and the uncertainty conveyed by internal semantic representations, which provide complementary views on model reliability. We present \textbf{HaluNet}, a lightweight and trainable neural framework that integrates multi granular token level uncertainties by combining semantic embeddings with probabilistic confidence and distributional uncertainty. Its multi branch architecture adaptively fuses what the model knows with the uncertainty expressed in its outputs, enabling efficient one pass hallucination detection. Experiments on SQuAD, TriviaQA, and Natural Questions show that HaluNet delivers strong detection performance and favorable computational efficiency, with or without access to context, highlighting its potential for real time hallucination detection in LLM based QA systems.

Motivation: 现有法律基准难以区分语言模型的推理能力和参数化知识，需要开发能够更忠实分离这两种能力的评估工具。

Method: 构建KCL基准，包含KCL-MCQA（283道多项选择题，1103个对齐判例）和KCL-Essay（169道开放式生成题，550个对齐判例，2739个实例级评分标准），提供问题级支持判例以实现推理能力与知识的分离。

Result: 对30多个模型的系统评估显示存在较大差距（尤其在KCL-Essay），专门用于推理的模型始终优于通用模型。

Conclusion: KCL基准有效评估语言模型的法律推理能力，揭示了当前模型的局限性，并提供了公开资源供进一步研究。

Abstract: We introduce the Korean Canonical Legal Benchmark (KCL), a benchmark designed to assess language models' legal reasoning capabilities independently of domain-specific knowledge. KCL provides question-level supporting precedents, enabling a more faithful disentanglement of reasoning ability from parameterized knowledge. KCL consists of two components: (1) KCL-MCQA, multiple-choice problems of 283 questions with 1,103 aligned precedents, and (2) KCL-Essay, open-ended generation problems of 169 questions with 550 aligned precedents and 2,739 instance-level rubrics for automated evaluation. Our systematic evaluation of 30+ models shows large remaining gaps, particularly in KCL-Essay, and that reasoning-specialized models consistently outperform their general-purpose counterparts.

TL;DR: CREST是一种无需训练的方法，通过识别和干预LLM中的"认知头"来引导推理过程，提高准确性同时减少计算成本。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型依赖长思维链推理，但这种方法效率低下：要么产生过多token导致高延迟，要么推理不稳定，在"思考不足"（步骤浅薄不一致）和"过度思考"（重复冗长推理）之间摇摆。

Method: CREST包含两个组件：(1)离线校准步骤，识别与特定认知行为（如验证和回溯）相关的"认知头"，并推导出头特定的引导向量；(2)推理时程序，通过旋转隐藏表示来抑制这些向量方向上的分量，从而自适应地抑制非生产性推理行为。

Result: 在多样化的推理基准测试和模型中，CREST将准确性提高了高达17.5%，同时减少了37.6%的token使用量。

Conclusion: CREST提供了一种简单有效的途径，能够实现更快、更可靠的大型语言模型推理，通过轻量级干预"认知头"来引导模型远离低效推理模式。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) often rely on long chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning to solve complex tasks. While effective, these trajectories are frequently inefficient, leading to high latency from excessive token generation, or unstable reasoning that alternates between underthinking (shallow, inconsistent steps) and overthinking (repetitive, verbose reasoning). In this work, we study the structure of reasoning trajectories and uncover specialized attention heads that correlate with distinct cognitive behaviors such as verification and backtracking. By lightly intervening on these heads at inference time, we can steer the model away from inefficient modes. Building on this insight, we propose CREST, a training-free method for Cognitive REasoning Steering at Test-time. CREST has two components: (1) an offline calibration step that identifies cognitive heads and derives head-specific steering vectors, and (2) an inference-time procedure that rotates hidden representations to suppress components along those vectors. CREST adaptively suppresses unproductive reasoning behaviors, yielding both higher accuracy and lower computational cost. Across diverse reasoning benchmarks and models, CREST improves accuracy by up to 17.5% while reducing token usage by 37.6%, offering a simple and effective pathway to faster, more reliable LLM reasoning.

TL;DR: R-Debater是一个基于论证记忆的智能体框架，用于生成多轮辩论，通过检索先验论据和证据来保持立场一致性并增强辩论质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有辩论系统在跨轮次保持立场一致性、有效回应对手以及提供证据支持方面存在不足。受修辞学和记忆研究启发，需要开发一个能够回忆和调整先前论据的框架，以生成更连贯、立场一致的辩论。

Method: R-Debater整合了辩论知识库（用于检索类似案例的证据和先前辩论动作）和基于角色的智能体（用于跨轮次构建连贯话语）。系统基于修辞学和记忆研究理论，将辩论视为回忆和调整先验论据的过程。

Result: 在标准化的ORCHID辩论数据集上评估，构建了包含1000个条目的检索语料库和32个跨7个领域的辩论测试集。在单轮话语生成任务中，R-Debater的InspireScore（主观、逻辑和事实维度）优于强LLM基线；在多轮对抗模拟中，Debatrix评分（论证、来源、语言和总体维度）也更高。20位经验丰富的辩论者的人工评估进一步证实了其一致性和证据使用能力。

Conclusion: 检索基础与结构化规划相结合能够产生更忠实、立场对齐且跨轮次连贯的辩论。R-Debater框架通过论证记忆机制显著提升了辩论生成的质量和一致性。

Abstract: We present R-Debater, an agentic framework for generating multi-turn debates built on argumentative memory. Grounded in rhetoric and memory studies, the system views debate as a process of recalling and adapting prior arguments to maintain stance consistency, respond to opponents, and support claims with evidence. Specifically, R-Debater integrates a debate knowledge base for retrieving case-like evidence and prior debate moves with a role-based agent that composes coherent utterances across turns. We evaluate on standardized ORCHID debates, constructing a 1,000-item retrieval corpus and a held-out set of 32 debates across seven domains. Two tasks are evaluated: next-utterance generation, assessed by InspireScore (subjective, logical, and factual), and adversarial multi-turn simulations, judged by Debatrix (argument, source, language, and overall). Compared with strong LLM baselines, R-Debater achieves higher single-turn and multi-turn scores. Human evaluation with 20 experienced debaters further confirms its consistency and evidence use, showing that combining retrieval grounding with structured planning yields more faithful, stance-aligned, and coherent debates across turns.

Multi-turn reward models (RMs) offer a scalable alternative and can provide valuable signals for guiding LLM training. While recent work has advanced multi-turn \textit{training} techniques, effective automated \textit{evaluation} specifically for multi-turn interactions lags behind. We observe that standard preference datasets, typically contrasting responses based only on the final conversational turn, provide insufficient signal to capture the nuances of multi-turn interactions. Instead, we find that incorporating contrasts spanning \textit{multiple} turns is critical for building robust multi-turn RMs. Motivated by this finding, we propose \textbf{MU}lti-\textbf{S}tep \textbf{I}nstruction \textbf{C}ontrast (MUSIC), an unsupervised data augmentation strategy that synthesizes contrastive conversation pairs exhibiting differences across multiple turns. Leveraging MUSIC on the Skywork preference dataset, we train a multi-turn RM based on the Gemma-2-9B-Instruct model. Empirical results demonstrate that our MUSIC-augmented RM outperforms baseline methods, achieving higher alignment with judgments from advanced proprietary LLM judges on multi-turn conversations, crucially, without compromising performance on standard single-turn RM benchmarks.

TL;DR: BIOME-Bench：用于评估大语言模型在多组学分析中生物分子相互作用推断和端到端通路机制阐明能力的标准化基准


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前多组学研究依赖通路富集分析，但存在通路资源的结构性限制（如更新滞后、功能冗余、对分子状态和干预的敏感性有限）。虽然已有研究探索使用大语言模型改进通路富集分析，但缺乏端到端多组学通路机制阐明的标准化基准，限制了可重复性进展。

Method: 通过严格的四阶段工作流程构建BIOME-Bench基准，评估大语言模型在多组学分析中的两个核心能力：1) 生物分子相互作用推断；2) 端到端多组学通路机制阐明。开发了针对这两个任务的评估协议，并在多个当代强模型上进行综合实验。

Result: 实验结果表明，现有模型在多组学分析中仍存在显著缺陷：难以可靠地区分细粒度的生物分子关系类型，以及生成忠实、稳健的通路级机制解释。

Conclusion: BIOME-Bench为评估大语言模型在多组学分析中的能力提供了标准化基准，揭示了当前模型的局限性，为未来改进提供了方向。

Abstract: Multi-omics studies often rely on pathway enrichment to interpret heterogeneous molecular changes, but pathway enrichment (PE)-based workflows inherit structural limitations of pathway resources, including curation lag, functional redundancy, and limited sensitivity to molecular states and interventions. Although recent work has explored using large language models (LLMs) to improve PE-based interpretation, the lack of a standardized benchmark for end-to-end multi-omics pathway mechanism elucidation has largely confined evaluation to small, manually curated datasets or ad hoc case studies, hindering reproducible progress. To address this issue, we introduce BIOME-Bench, constructed via a rigorous four-stage workflow, to evaluate two core capabilities of LLMs in multi-omics analysis: Biomolecular Interaction Inference and end-to-end Multi-Omics Pathway Mechanism Elucidation. We develop evaluation protocols for both tasks and conduct comprehensive experiments across multiple strong contemporary models. Experimental results demonstrate that existing models still exhibit substantial deficiencies in multi-omics analysis, struggling to reliably distinguish fine-grained biomolecular relation types and to generate faithful, robust pathway-level mechanistic explanations.

TL;DR: 该论文对大型语言模型在推理任务中的计算效率进行了评估，发现混合专家架构在性能与效率之间取得了最佳平衡，并识别出推理计算存在饱和点。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前文献往往忽视生成长推理序列带来的显著计算负担。在工业应用中，模型选择不仅取决于原始准确性，还受资源约束和推理成本的影响。需要评估不同模型在推理任务中的计算效率。

Method: 对当代和早期开源LLM进行测试时计算感知评估，在数学和推理密集型基准测试中绘制它们的帕累托前沿，追踪帕累托效率随时间变化的轨迹，并分析推理计算饱和点。

Result: 发现混合专家架构在评估设置中能很好地平衡性能与效率；推导出关于单位计算精度增益的新兴趋势；证明推理计算存在饱和点，超过特定阈值后精度增益会减少。

Conclusion: 虽然扩展推理能力有益，但无法克服模型在特定复杂性方面的内在限制。混合专家架构是平衡性能与效率的有力候选方案，推理计算存在明确的收益递减点。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are demonstrating rapid improvements on complex reasoning benchmarks, particularly when allowed to utilize intermediate reasoning steps before converging on a final solution. However, current literature often overlooks the significant computational burden associated with generating long reasoning sequences. For industrial applications, model selection depends not only on raw accuracy but also on resource constraints and inference costs. In this work, we conduct a test-time-compute aware evaluation of both contemporary and older open-source LLMs, mapping their Pareto frontiers across math- and reasoning-intensive benchmarks. Our findings identify the Mixture of Experts (MoE) architecture as a strong candidate to balance performance and efficiency in our evaluation setting. Furthermore, we trace the trajectory of Pareto efficiency over time to derive an emergent trend regarding accuracy gain per unit of compute. Finally, we demonstrate that there is a saturation point for inference-time compute. Beyond a certain threshold, accuracy gains diminish, indicating that while extended reasoning capabilities are beneficial, they cannot overcome intrinsic model limitations regarding specific complexities.

TL;DR: 该论文介绍了一门NLP伦理课程及其教学方法，通过主动学习、互动活动和"以教促学"等方式，在四年间跨机构、跨教育层次实施，并产生了可复用的教学材料和实际教育产品。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着NLP系统日益普及，将伦理考量融入NLP教育变得至关重要。然而，课程开发面临双重挑战：领域在学术界和工业界的快速演变，以及需要培养超越传统技术培训的批判性思维。

Method: 采用基于主动学习的教学方法，包括互动课程、实践活动和"以教促学"方法。课程在四年间不断优化，适应不同机构、教育层次和跨学科背景。

Result: 课程产生了许多可复用产品，包括教学材料和由学生制作的面向不同受众的实际教育产品。课程已在多个机构和教育层次成功实施。

Conclusion: 通过分享这一方法和经验，作者希望为寻求将社会影响考量融入课程的教育工作者提供启发，促进NLP教育中伦理维度的整合。

Abstract: As Natural Language Processing (NLP) systems become more pervasive, integrating ethical considerations into NLP education has become essential. However, this presents inherent challenges in curriculum development: the field's rapid evolution from both academia and industry, and the need to foster critical thinking beyond traditional technical training. We introduce our course on Ethical Aspects in NLP and our pedagogical approach, grounded in active learning through interactive sessions, hands-on activities, and "learning by teaching" methods. Over four years, the course has been refined and adapted across different institutions, educational levels, and interdisciplinary backgrounds; it has also yielded many reusable products, both in the form of teaching materials and in the form of actual educational products aimed at diverse audiences, made by the students themselves. By sharing our approach and experience, we hope to provide inspiration for educators seeking to incorporate social impact considerations into their curricula.

*Yanan Long*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为"三角测量"的因果标准，用于验证多语言模型中机制性解释的可靠性，要求电路在跨语言变体中保持必要性和充分性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多语言模型在整体性能上表现良好，但在不同语言、文字和文化间的行为不可预测。现有机制性解释缺乏因果标准，无法区分真实电路和虚假相关。

Method: 提出"三角测量"方法：1)定义"参考家族"作为保持谓词意义的变体；2)要求电路满足必要性（消融会破坏目标行为）、充分性（激活补丁能转移行为）和不变性（在参考家族中保持方向稳定和足够幅度）；3)结合自动电路发现，通过三角测量接受或拒绝候选子图。

Result: 将三角测量形式化为因果抽象中的近似变换分数，建立了与实用可解释性议程的连接，并提出了跨模型家族、语言对和任务的比较实验协议。

Conclusion: 三角测量为机制性主张提供了可证伪的标准，能够过滤掉通过单环境测试但在跨语言不变性上失败的虚假电路，提高了多语言模型解释的可靠性。

Abstract: Multilingual language models achieve strong aggregate performance yet often behave unpredictably across languages, scripts, and cultures. We argue that mechanistic explanations for such models should satisfy a \emph{causal} standard: claims must survive causal interventions and must \emph{cross-reference} across environments that perturb surface form while preserving meaning. We formalize \emph{reference families} as predicate-preserving variants and introduce \emph{triangulation}, an acceptance rule requiring necessity (ablating the circuit degrades the target behavior), sufficiency (patching activations transfers the behavior), and invariance (both effects remain directionally stable and of sufficient magnitude across the reference family). To supply candidate subgraphs, we adopt automatic circuit discovery and \emph{accept or reject} those candidates by triangulation. We ground triangulation in causal abstraction by casting it as an approximate transformation score over a distribution of interchange interventions, connect it to the pragmatic interpretability agenda, and present a comparative experimental protocol across multiple model families, language pairs, and tasks. Triangulation provides a falsifiable standard for mechanistic claims that filters spurious circuits passing single-environment tests but failing cross-lingual invariance.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Encyclo-K是一个基于知识陈述的动态基准测试框架，通过从权威教科书中提取独立知识陈述并在测试时随机组合成问题，解决了现有基准测试的数据污染、单知识点评估和专家标注成本高三大限制。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基准测试主要存在三个根本性限制：1) 容易受到数据污染的影响；2) 仅限于单知识点评估；3) 依赖昂贵的领域专家标注。需要重新思考基准测试的构建方式，以更有效地评估大语言模型的能力边界。

Method: 从权威教科书中提取独立的知识陈述作为基本单位，然后在测试时通过随机抽样动态组合这些陈述（每个问题包含8-10个陈述）来构建评估问题。标注者只需验证格式合规性，无需领域专业知识。

Result: 在50多个LLM上的实验表明，Encyclo-K具有强大的区分能力：即使是表现最好的OpenAI-GPT-5.1也仅达到62.07%的准确率。推理模型准确率范围为16.04%到62.07%，聊天模型为9.71%到50.40%。模型排名在不同动态生成的问题集中保持稳定。

Conclusion: Encyclo-K作为一个可扩展的框架，通过动态评估和多陈述综合理解，有效解决了现有基准测试的局限性，为评估LLM对多个细粒度学科知识陈述的综合理解能力提供了可靠方法。

Abstract: Benchmarks play a crucial role in tracking the rapid advancement of large language models (LLMs) and identifying their capability boundaries. However, existing benchmarks predominantly curate questions at the question level, suffering from three fundamental limitations: vulnerability to data contamination, restriction to single-knowledge-point assessment, and reliance on costly domain expert annotation. We propose Encyclo-K, a statement-based benchmark that rethinks benchmark construction from the ground up. Our key insight is that knowledge statements, not questions, can serve as the unit of curation, and questions can then be constructed from them. We extract standalone knowledge statements from authoritative textbooks and dynamically compose them into evaluation questions through random sampling at test time. This design directly addresses all three limitations: the combinatorial space is too vast to memorize, and model rankings remain stable across dynamically generated question sets, enabling reliable periodic dataset refresh; each question aggregates 8-10 statements for comprehensive multi-knowledge assessment; annotators only verify formatting compliance without requiring domain expertise, substantially reducing annotation costs. Experiments on over 50 LLMs demonstrate that Encyclo-K poses substantial challenges with strong discriminative power. Even the top-performing OpenAI-GPT-5.1 achieves only 62.07% accuracy, and model performance displays a clear gradient distribution--reasoning models span from 16.04% to 62.07%, while chat models range from 9.71% to 50.40%. These results validate the challenges introduced by dynamic evaluation and multi-statement comprehensive understanding. These findings establish Encyclo-K as a scalable framework for dynamic evaluation of LLMs' comprehensive understanding over multiple fine-grained disciplinary knowledge statements.

Motivation: Hyper-Connections (HC)通过扩展残差流宽度和多样化连接模式提升了性能，但破坏了残差连接固有的恒等映射特性，导致训练不稳定、可扩展性受限和内存访问开销增加

Method: 提出mHC框架，将HC的残差连接空间投影到特定流形以恢复恒等映射特性，同时结合严格的基础设施优化确保效率

Result: 实验证明mHC在规模化训练中有效，提供实质性性能改进和优越的可扩展性

Conclusion: mHC作为HC的灵活实用扩展，将有助于深入理解拓扑架构设计，为基础模型的演进指明有前景的方向

Abstract: Recently, studies exemplified by Hyper-Connections (HC) have extended the ubiquitous residual connection paradigm established over the past decade by expanding the residual stream width and diversifying connectivity patterns. While yielding substantial performance gains, this diversification fundamentally compromises the identity mapping property intrinsic to the residual connection, which causes severe training instability and restricted scalability, and additionally incurs notable memory access overhead. To address these challenges, we propose Manifold-Constrained Hyper-Connections (mHC), a general framework that projects the residual connection space of HC onto a specific manifold to restore the identity mapping property, while incorporating rigorous infrastructure optimization to ensure efficiency. Empirical experiments demonstrate that mHC is effective for training at scale, offering tangible performance improvements and superior scalability. We anticipate that mHC, as a flexible and practical extension of HC, will contribute to a deeper understanding of topological architecture design and suggest promising directions for the evolution of foundational models.

TL;DR: BEDA框架通过将信念估计转化为生成约束，为战略对话提供了一种简单通用的机制，在对抗、合作和谈判三种设置中均优于基线方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有战略对话研究虽然能准确估计信念，但缺乏使用这些信念进行生成的机制。本文旨在填补这一空白，通过形式化核心对话行为并建立信念约束机制。

Method: 提出BEDA框架，包含世界集合、信念估计器和条件生成器。首先形式化对抗和对齐两种核心对话行为，然后通过概率约束将信念估计转化为生成约束，确保生成的话语与推断信念一致。

Result: 在三种设置中均取得显著改进：在CKBG（对抗）中成功率提升至少5.0个百分点（GPT-4.1-nano提升20.6点）；在Mutual Friends（合作）中平均提升9.3点；在CaSiNo（谈判）中达成最优交易。

Conclusion: 将信念估计作为约束条件为可靠的战略对话提供了一种简单、通用的机制，BEDA框架在不同对话场景中均表现出色。

Abstract: Strategic dialogue requires agents to execute distinct dialogue acts, for which belief estimation is essential. While prior work often estimates beliefs accurately, it lacks a principled mechanism to use those beliefs during generation. We bridge this gap by first formalizing two core acts Adversarial and Alignment, and by operationalizing them via probabilistic constraints on what an agent may generate. We instantiate this idea in BEDA, a framework that consists of the world set, the belief estimator for belief estimation, and the conditional generator that selects acts and realizes utterances consistent with the inferred beliefs. Across three settings, Conditional Keeper Burglar (CKBG, adversarial), Mutual Friends (MF, cooperative), and CaSiNo (negotiation), BEDA consistently outperforms strong baselines: on CKBG it improves success rate by at least 5.0 points across backbones and by 20.6 points with GPT-4.1-nano; on Mutual Friends it achieves an average improvement of 9.3 points; and on CaSiNo it achieves the optimal deal relative to all baselines. These results indicate that casting belief estimation as constraints provides a simple, general mechanism for reliable strategic dialogue.

TL;DR: ADOPT：一种用于多步LLM管道的自适应依赖感知提示优化框架，通过建模步骤间依赖关系实现精确的文本梯度估计，优于现有提示优化方法


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多步LLM管道能有效解决复杂任务，但其性能严重依赖每一步的提示。联合优化这些提示很困难，因为缺乏步骤级监督和步骤间依赖关系。现有的端到端提示优化方法在这些条件下表现不佳，往往产生次优或不稳定的更新。

Method: ADOPT框架显式建模每个LLM步骤与最终任务结果之间的依赖关系，实现类似计算解析导数的精确文本梯度估计。它将文本梯度估计与梯度更新解耦，将多提示优化简化为灵活的单提示优化步骤，并采用基于Shapley值的机制自适应分配优化资源。

Result: 在真实世界数据集和多样化管道结构上的实验表明，ADOPT是有效且鲁棒的，始终优于最先进的提示优化基线方法。

Conclusion: ADOPT通过建模步骤间依赖关系和实现精确的文本梯度估计，成功解决了多步LLM管道中提示优化的挑战，为复杂任务的多步LLM管道提供了有效的提示优化解决方案。

Abstract: Multi-step LLM pipelines invoke large language models multiple times in a structured sequence and can effectively solve complex tasks, but their performance heavily depends on the prompts used at each step. Jointly optimizing these prompts is difficult due to missing step-level supervision and inter-step dependencies. Existing end-to-end prompt optimization methods struggle under these conditions and often yield suboptimal or unstable updates. We propose ADOPT, an Adaptive Dependency-aware Prompt Optimization framework for multi-step LLM pipelines. ADOPT explicitly models the dependency between each LLM step and the final task outcome, enabling precise text-gradient estimation analogous to computing analytical derivatives. It decouples textual gradient estimation from gradient updates, reducing multi-prompt optimization to flexible single-prompt optimization steps, and employs a Shapley-based mechanism to adaptively allocate optimization resources. Experiments on real-world datasets and diverse pipeline structures show that ADOPT is effective and robust, consistently outperforming state-of-the-art prompt optimization baselines.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出Thought Gestalt模型，一种双层次抽象（词元与句子级"思想"状态）的循环Transformer，通过跨注意力机制将句子表示存入记忆，提升语言建模效率与关系方向泛化能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统Transformer语言模型主要依赖表层共现统计，缺乏对实体和事件的全局一致潜在表示，导致关系方向泛化（如反转诅咒）、上下文错误和数据效率低下。受认知科学启发，人类理解语言时将输入流转换为紧凑的事件样表示，这些表示在记忆中持久存在，而逐字形式短暂。

Method: 提出Thought Gestalt模型：1）双层次抽象建模：词元级和句子级"思想"状态；2）循环Transformer架构：逐句生成词元，同时跨注意力访问先前句子表示的记忆；3）统一参数与目标：使用同一组参数生成词元和句子表示，通过保留写入记忆的句子表示计算图，未来词元损失的梯度通过跨注意力反向传播优化早期句子向量生成参数。

Result: 1）扩展实验中，TG始终优于匹配的GPT-2及其他基线，缩放拟合表明GPT-2需要约5-8%更多数据和33-42%更多参数才能达到TG的损失水平；2）在父子反转诅咒探针上，TG减少了关系方向泛化错误。

Conclusion: Thought Gestalt模型通过引入句子级"思想"状态的双层次抽象，模仿人类认知中的事件样表示，显著提升了语言建模的数据效率和关系方向泛化能力，为构建更鲁棒、认知合理的语言模型提供了新方向。

Abstract: Transformer language models can generate strikingly natural text by modeling language as a sequence of tokens. Yet, by relying primarily on surface-level co-occurrence statistics, they fail to form globally consistent latent representations of entities and events, lack of which contributes to brittleness in relational direction (e.g., reversal curse), contextualization errors, and data inefficiency. On the other hand, cognitive science shows that human comprehension involves converting the input linguistic stream into compact, event-like representations that persist in memory while verbatim form is short-lived. Motivated by this view, we introduce Thought Gestalt (TG) model, a recurrent Transformer that models language at two levels of abstraction - tokens and sentence-level "thought" states. TG generates the tokens of one sentence at a time while cross-attending to a memory of prior sentence representations. In TG, token and sentence representations are generated using the same set of model parameters and trained with a single objective, the next-token cross-entropy: by retaining the computation graph of sentence representations written to memory, gradients from future token losses flow backward through cross-attention to optimize the parameters generating earlier sentence vectors. In scaling experiments, TG consistently improves efficiency over matched GPT-2 runs, among other baselines, with scaling fits indicating GPT-2 requires ~5-8% more data and ~33-42% more parameters to match TG's loss. TG also reduces errors on relational direction generalization on a father-son reversal curse probe.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: AdaGReS是一个用于检索增强生成(RAG)的冗余感知上下文选择框架，通过优化结合查询-块相关性和集合内冗余惩罚的目标函数，在token预算约束下进行贪婪选择，并自适应校准相关性与冗余性权衡参数。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 标准top-k检索在RAG中经常返回冗余或近似重复的文本块，这会浪费token预算并降低下游生成质量。现有方法缺乏对冗余性的有效控制，且需要手动调整相关性与冗余性的权衡参数。

Method: 提出AdaGReS框架，包含：1) 集合级目标函数，结合查询-块相关性和集合内冗余惩罚；2) 在token预算约束下基于边际增益进行贪婪选择；3) 封闭式、实例自适应的相关性与冗余性权衡参数校准，无需手动调整，能适应候选池统计特性和预算限制。

Result: 在开放域问答(Natural Questions)和高冗余生物医学(药物)语料库上的实验表明，AdaGReS在冗余控制和上下文质量方面持续改进，转化为更好的端到端答案质量和跨设置的鲁棒性。理论分析显示所提目标函数在实际嵌入相似性条件下具有epsilon-近似子模性，为贪婪选择提供接近最优性保证。

Conclusion: AdaGReS通过冗余感知的上下文选择和自适应参数校准，有效解决了RAG中冗余文本块浪费token预算的问题，提高了检索增强生成的整体性能，无需手动调参且具有理论保证。

Abstract: Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) is highly sensitive to the quality of selected context, yet standard top-k retrieval often returns redundant or near-duplicate chunks that waste token budget and degrade downstream generation. We present AdaGReS, a redundancy-aware context selection framework for token-budgeted RAG that optimizes a set-level objective combining query-chunk relevance and intra-set redundancy penalties. AdaGReS performs greedy selection under a token-budget constraint using marginal gains derived from the objective, and introduces a closed-form, instance-adaptive calibration of the relevance-redundancy trade-off parameter to eliminate manual tuning and adapt to candidate-pool statistics and budget limits. We further provide a theoretical analysis showing that the proposed objective exhibits epsilon-approximate submodularity under practical embedding similarity conditions, yielding near-optimality guarantees for greedy selection. Experiments on open-domain question answering (Natural Questions) and a high-redundancy biomedical (drug) corpus demonstrate consistent improvements in redundancy control and context quality, translating to better end-to-end answer quality and robustness across settings.

TL;DR: PartMotionEdit：基于部件级语义调制的细粒度3D人体运动编辑框架，通过部件感知运动调制模块实现精确的局部运动控制


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有文本驱动的3D人体运动编辑方法虽然取得显著进展，但由于其全局建模特性，难以精确控制详细、部件特定的运动。需要一种能够实现细粒度、部件级运动编辑的解决方案。

Method: 1. Part-aware Motion Modulation (PMM)模块：基于预定义的五部分身体分解，动态预测每个身体部件的时间变化调制权重，实现精确可解释的局部运动编辑。2. 部件级相似度曲线监督机制：采用双层归一化增强，指导PMM学习语义一致且可编辑的身体部件分布。3. Bidirectional Motion Interaction (BMI)模块：利用双向跨模态注意力实现文本指令与运动语义之间更准确的语义对齐。

Result: 在知名基准测试上进行的大量定量和定性评估表明，PartMotionEdit在3D人体运动编辑任务上优于现有最先进方法。

Conclusion: PartMotionEdit通过部件级语义调制实现了细粒度、精确可控的3D人体运动编辑，解决了现有全局建模方法在局部运动控制方面的局限性，为文本驱动的运动编辑提供了更精细的控制能力。

Abstract: Existing text-driven 3D human motion editing methods have demonstrated significant progress, but are still difficult to precisely control over detailed, part-specific motions due to their global modeling nature. In this paper, we propose PartMotionEdit, a novel fine-grained motion editing framework that operates via part-level semantic modulation. The core of PartMotionEdit is a Part-aware Motion Modulation (PMM) module, which builds upon a predefined five-part body decomposition. PMM dynamically predicts time-varying modulation weights for each body part, enabling precise and interpretable editing of local motions. To guide the training of PMM, we also introduce a part-level similarity curve supervision mechanism enhanced with dual-layer normalization. This mechanism assists PMM in learning semantically consistent and editable distributions across all body parts. Furthermore, we design a Bidirectional Motion Interaction (BMI) module. It leverages bidirectional cross-modal attention to achieve more accurate semantic alignment between textual instructions and motion semantics. Extensive quantitative and qualitative evaluations on a well-known benchmark demonstrate that PartMotionEdit outperforms the state-of-the-art methods.

### [128] [The Drill-Down and Fabricate Test (DDFT): A Protocol for Measuring Epistemic Robustness in Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.23850)
*Rahul Baxi*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 论文提出DDFT协议评估语言模型的认知稳健性，发现模型规模与稳健性无关，错误检测能力是关键瓶颈


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前语言模型评估主要测量理想条件下的知识掌握程度，但无法评估在现实压力下的稳健性。静态基准测试如MMLU和TruthfulQA无法区分模型是缺乏知识还是验证机制在信息退化或对抗性攻击下崩溃。

Method: 引入Drill-Down and Fabricate Test (DDFT)协议，测量认知稳健性：模型在渐进语义压缩和对抗性伪造下保持事实准确性的能力。提出两系统认知模型：语义系统生成流畅文本，认知验证器验证事实准确性。评估9个前沿模型在8个知识领域和5个压缩级别（共1800轮评估）。

Result: 认知稳健性与传统设计范式正交。参数数量(r=0.083, p=0.832)和架构类型(r=0.153, p=0.695)均不能显著预测稳健性，表明其源于训练方法和验证机制。错误检测能力强烈预测整体稳健性(rho=-0.817, p=0.007)，是关键瓶颈。旗舰模型虽规模大但表现出脆弱性，而较小模型可实现稳健性能。

Conclusion: DDFT框架为关键应用部署前评估认知稳健性提供了理论基础和实用工具，挑战了模型规模与可靠性关系的假设，强调需要关注训练方法和验证机制而非单纯扩大规模。

Abstract: Current language model evaluations measure what models know under ideal conditions but not how robustly they know it under realistic stress. Static benchmarks like MMLU and TruthfulQA cannot distinguish a model that lacks knowledge from one whose verification mechanisms collapse when information degrades or adversaries probe for weaknesses. We introduce the Drill-Down and Fabricate Test (DDFT), a protocol that measures epistemic robustness: a model's ability to maintain factual accuracy under progressive semantic compression and adversarial fabrication. We propose a two-system cognitive model comprising a Semantic System that generates fluent text and an Epistemic Verifier that validates factual accuracy. Our findings, based on evaluating 9 frontier models across 8 knowledge domains at 5 compression levels (1,800 turn-level evaluations), reveal that epistemic robustness is orthogonal to conventional design paradigms. Neither parameter count (r=0.083, p=0.832) nor architectural type (r=0.153, p=0.695) significantly predicts robustness, suggesting it emerges from training methodology and verification mechanisms distinct from current approaches. Error detection capability strongly predicts overall robustness (rho=-0.817, p=0.007), indicating this is the critical bottleneck. We find that flagship models exhibit brittleness despite their scale, while smaller models can achieve robust performance, challenging assumptions about the relationship between model size and reliability. The DDFT framework provides both theoretical foundation and practical tools for assessing epistemic robustness before deployment in critical applications.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: CASCADE是一个自我进化的LLM智能体框架，通过持续学习和自我反思实现从"工具使用"到"技能获取"的转变，在材料科学和化学研究任务中达到93.3%的成功率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前LLM智能体依赖预定义工具或脆弱的工具生成，限制了其在复杂科学任务中的能力和适应性。需要从"LLM+工具使用"向"LLM+技能获取"转变，实现更强大的科学AI助手。

Method: CASCADE框架通过两种元技能实现自我进化：1) 持续学习（通过网页搜索和代码提取）；2) 自我反思（通过内省和知识图谱探索）。该框架还支持人机协作和记忆整合。

Result: 在SciSkillBench基准测试（116个材料科学和化学研究任务）中，CASCADE使用GPT-5达到93.3%的成功率，相比没有进化机制的35.4%有显著提升。展示了在计算分析、自主实验室实验和论文选择性复现等实际应用中的有效性。

Conclusion: CASCADE能够积累可执行的技能，这些技能可以在智能体和科学家之间共享，为实现可扩展的AI辅助科学研究迈出了重要一步，代表了LLM智能体从工具使用到技能获取的范式转变。

Abstract: Large language model (LLM) agents currently depend on predefined tools or brittle tool generation, constraining their capability and adaptability to complex scientific tasks. We introduce CASCADE, a self-evolving agentic framework representing an early instantiation of the transition from "LLM + tool use" to "LLM + skill acquisition". CASCADE enables agents to master complex external tools and codify knowledge through two meta-skills: continuous learning via web search and code extraction, and self-reflection via introspection and knowledge graph exploration, among others. We evaluate CASCADE on SciSkillBench, a benchmark of 116 materials science and chemistry research tasks. CASCADE achieves a 93.3% success rate using GPT-5, compared to 35.4% without evolution mechanisms. We further demonstrate real-world applications in computational analysis, autonomous laboratory experiments, and selective reproduction of published papers. Along with human-agent collaboration and memory consolidation, CASCADE accumulates executable skills that can be shared across agents and scientists, moving toward scalable AI-assisted scientific research.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 准确的疾病预测对及时干预、有效治疗和减少医疗并发症至关重要。符号AI在医疗保健中应用有限，主要因为构建高质量知识库需要大量人工努力

Method: McCoy框架结合大型语言模型(LLM)与答案集编程(ASP)：1) LLM将医学文献翻译成ASP代码；2) 将生成的ASP代码与患者数据结合；3) 使用ASP求解器处理得到最终诊断

Result: 初步结果显示McCoy在小规模疾病诊断任务上表现出色，实现了稳健且可解释的预测框架

Conclusion: McCoy框架成功克服了符号AI在医疗领域应用的知识库构建障碍，通过LLM与ASP的结合，创建了一个既强大又可解释的疾病预测系统

Abstract: Accurate disease prediction is vital for timely intervention, effective treatment, and reducing medical complications. While symbolic AI has been applied in healthcare, its adoption remains limited due to the effort required for constructing high-quality knowledge bases. This work introduces McCoy, a framework that combines Large Language Models (LLMs) with Answer Set Programming (ASP) to overcome this barrier. McCoy orchestrates an LLM to translate medical literature into ASP code, combines it with patient data, and processes it using an ASP solver to arrive at the final diagnosis. This integration yields a robust, interpretable prediction framework that leverages the strengths of both paradigms. Preliminary results show McCoy has strong performance on small-scale disease diagnosis tasks.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: SPARK是一个基于多智能体LLM的个性化搜索框架，通过角色化智能体协作实现动态检索和个性化，模拟人类信息寻求行为的复杂性和流动性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 个性化搜索需要建模用户不断演化的多维信息需求，但现有系统受限于静态用户画像或单一检索流程，无法有效捕捉人类信息寻求行为的复杂性、流动性和上下文敏感性。

Method: SPARK框架包含：1) 定义角色、专业知识、任务上下文和领域的角色空间；2) 动态解释查询并激活相关专业智能体的角色协调器；3) 每个智能体执行独立的检索增强生成过程，配备专用长短期记忆存储和上下文感知推理模块；4) 通过共享记忆库、迭代辩论和中继式知识转移等结构化通信协议促进智能体间协作。

Result: 该框架产生了关于协调效率、个性化质量和认知负载分布的可测试预测，同时包含用于持续角色细化的自适应学习机制。通过整合细粒度智能体专业化与协作检索，SPARK为下一代搜索系统提供了洞察。

Conclusion: SPARK展示了分布式智能体行为如何通过最小协调规则产生涌现的个性化特性，为能够捕捉人类信息寻求行为复杂性、流动性和上下文敏感性的下一代搜索系统提供了理论基础和实现框架。

Abstract: Personalized search demands the ability to model users' evolving, multi-dimensional information needs; a challenge for systems constrained by static profiles or monolithic retrieval pipelines. We present SPARK (Search Personalization via Agent-Driven Retrieval and Knowledge-sharing), a framework in which coordinated persona-based large language model (LLM) agents deliver task-specific retrieval and emergent personalization. SPARK formalizes a persona space defined by role, expertise, task context, and domain, and introduces a Persona Coordinator that dynamically interprets incoming queries to activate the most relevant specialized agents. Each agent executes an independent retrieval-augmented generation process, supported by dedicated long- and short-term memory stores and context-aware reasoning modules. Inter-agent collaboration is facilitated through structured communication protocols, including shared memory repositories, iterative debate, and relay-style knowledge transfer. Drawing on principles from cognitive architectures, multi-agent coordination theory, and information retrieval, SPARK models how emergent personalization properties arise from distributed agent behaviors governed by minimal coordination rules. The framework yields testable predictions regarding coordination efficiency, personalization quality, and cognitive load distribution, while incorporating adaptive learning mechanisms for continuous persona refinement. By integrating fine-grained agent specialization with cooperative retrieval, SPARK provides insights for next-generation search systems capable of capturing the complexity, fluidity, and context sensitivity of human information-seeking behavior.

*Evgenii Rudakov,Jonathan Shock,Benjamin Ultan Cowley*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出一种无需训练、基于图结构的交互式推理方法，用于解决ARC-AGI-3基准测试中的游戏任务，通过视觉处理和系统化状态空间探索显著优于当前最先进的LLMs。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: ARC-AGI-3基准测试包含需要通过有限交互推断任务机制的游戏式任务，当前最先进的LLMs无法可靠解决这些任务。需要一种能够形成假设、测试假设并跟踪已发现机制的方法，特别是在稀疏反馈环境中。

Method: 结合基于视觉的帧处理与使用图结构表示的系统化状态空间探索。方法包括：将视觉帧分割为有意义的组件，基于视觉显著性优先选择动作，维护已探索状态和转换的有向图，通过跟踪已访问状态和已测试动作，优先选择提供到未测试状态-动作对最短路径的动作。

Result: 在ARC-AGI-3预览挑战中，该方法在六个游戏中解决了52个关卡的中位数30个，在私有排行榜上排名第3，显著优于前沿的基于LLM的智能体。

Conclusion: 即使没有学习，显式的图结构探索也可以作为交互式推理的强大基线，并强调了在稀疏反馈环境中系统化状态跟踪和动作优先级的重要性，这些环境中当前LLMs无法捕捉任务动态。

Abstract: We present a training-free graph-based approach for solving interactive reasoning tasks in the ARC-AGI-3 benchmark. ARC-AGI-3 comprises game-like tasks where agents must infer task mechanics through limited interactions, and adapt to increasing complexity as levels progress. Success requires forming hypotheses, testing them, and tracking discovered mechanics. The benchmark has revealed that state-of-the-art LLMs are currently incapable of reliably solving these tasks. Our method combines vision-based frame processing with systematic state-space exploration using graph-structured representations. It segments visual frames into meaningful components, prioritizes actions based on visual salience, and maintains a directed graph of explored states and transitions. By tracking visited states and tested actions, the agent prioritizes actions that provide the shortest path to untested state-action pairs. On the ARC-AGI-3 Preview Challenge, this structured exploration strategy solves a median of 30 out of 52 levels across six games and ranks 3rd on the private leaderboard, substantially outperforming frontier LLM-based agents. These results demonstrate that explicit graph-structured exploration, even without learning, can serve as a strong baseline for interactive reasoning and underscore the importance of systematic state tracking and action prioritization in sparse-feedback environments where current LLMs fail to capture task dynamics. The code is open source and available at https://github.com/dolphin-in-a-coma/arc-agi-3-just-explore.

*Lijun Zhang,Lin Li,Wei Wei,Yajie Qi,Huizhong Song,Jun Wang,Yaodong Yang,Jiye Liang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: RSA是一种风险感知的分步对齐方法，通过嵌套风险度量在策略优化中显式纳入风险意识，以解决传统风险中性对齐方法在应对罕见但灾难性有害行为方面的不足。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有安全对齐方法（如Safe RLHF和SACPO）通常采用风险中性范式，无法有效处理参考策略偏差带来的风险，且对罕见但潜在灾难性有害行为的鲁棒性有限。需要一种能显式纳入风险意识的方法来确保语言模型的安全性和可信度。

Method: 提出风险感知分步对齐（RSA）方法：1）将安全对齐表述为令牌级风险感知约束策略优化问题；2）通过分步对齐程序解决该问题，利用嵌套风险度量推导令牌级策略更新；3）设计旨在减轻模型偏离参考策略的风险，并显式抑制低概率高影响的有害行为。

Result: 实验结果表明，该方法在保持高水平帮助性的同时确保强安全性，并显著抑制尾部风险（即低概率但高影响的不安全响应）。理论分析在温和假设下证明了策略最优性。

Conclusion: RSA通过将风险意识显式纳入对齐过程，有效解决了传统风险中性方法的局限性，在保持模型有用性的同时增强了安全性和对罕见有害行为的鲁棒性。

Abstract: When fine-tuning pre-trained Language Models (LMs) to exhibit desired behaviors, maintaining control over risk is critical for ensuring both safety and trustworthiness. Most existing safety alignment methods, such as Safe RLHF and SACPO, typically operate under a risk-neutral paradigm that is insufficient to address the risks arising from deviations from the reference policy and offers limited robustness against rare but potentially catastrophic harmful behaviors. To address this limitation, we propose Risk-aware Stepwise Alignment (RSA), a novel alignment method that explicitly incorporates risk awareness into the policy optimization process by leveraging a class of nested risk measures. Specifically, RSA formulates safety alignment as a token-level risk-aware constrained policy optimization problem and solves it through a stepwise alignment procedure that yields token-level policy updates derived from the nested risk measures. This design offers two key benefits: (1) it mitigates risks induced by excessive model shift away from a reference policy, and (2) it explicitly suppresses low-probability yet high-impact harmful behaviors. Moreover, we provide theoretical analysis on policy optimality under mild assumptions. Experimental results demonstrate that our method achieves high levels of helpfulness while ensuring strong safety and significantly suppresses tail risks, namely low-probability yet high-impact unsafe responses.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: AI智能体需要能够解决广泛物理任务并泛化到新任务和环境。现有方法通常在世界模型的状态-动作轨迹上训练，然后在输入空间进行规划。最近出现的方法在表示空间进行规划，声称能通过抽象无关细节实现更高效的规划，但缺乏对这些方法技术选择的系统分析。

Method: 将这类方法定义为JEPA-WM模型家族，系统研究模型架构、训练目标和规划算法等关键组件。在模拟环境和真实机器人数据上进行实验，分析不同配置对规划成功率的影响。

Result: 通过实验找到了JEPA-WM家族中的最优方法配置，提出的模型在导航和操作任务上都超越了DINO-WM和V-JEPA-2-AC两个基准模型。

Conclusion: 系统研究了JEPA-WM模型家族的技术选择，确定了最优配置方案，为在表示空间进行高效规划的世界模型方法提供了实证指导，推动了AI智能体在物理任务中的泛化能力发展。

Abstract: A long-standing challenge in AI is to develop agents capable of solving a wide range of physical tasks and generalizing to new, unseen tasks and environments. A popular recent approach involves training a world model from state-action trajectories and subsequently use it with a planning algorithm to solve new tasks. Planning is commonly performed in the input space, but a recent family of methods has introduced planning algorithms that optimize in the learned representation space of the world model, with the promise that abstracting irrelevant details yields more efficient planning. In this work, we characterize models from this family as JEPA-WMs and investigate the technical choices that make algorithms from this class work. We propose a comprehensive study of several key components with the objective of finding the optimal approach within the family. We conducted experiments using both simulated environments and real-world robotic data, and studied how the model architecture, the training objective, and the planning algorithm affect planning success. We combine our findings to propose a model that outperforms two established baselines, DINO-WM and V-JEPA-2-AC, in both navigation and manipulation tasks.

TL;DR: 该研究评估了三种主流大语言模型在密苏里大学数学竞赛问题上的表现，发现DeepSeek-V3在所有数学领域表现最佳，但所有模型在几何问题上都表现薄弱，揭示了不同模型特有的错误模式。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究大多使用相同的数据集评估大语言模型的数学推理能力，限制了研究结果的普适性，无法全面捕捉数学任务中的多样化挑战。本研究旨在通过分析大语言模型在代表性不足的数学竞赛问题上的表现，提供更深入的见解。

Method: 研究使用密苏里大学数学竞赛中的微积分、解析几何和离散数学问题，对GPT-4o-mini、Gemini-2.0-Flash和DeepSeek-V3三种大语言模型进行测试。将模型的回答与已知正确答案进行比较以确定准确性，并分析推理过程以探索错误模式。

Result: DeepSeek-V3在微积分、解析几何和离散数学三个领域均表现最佳，包括推理过程和最终答案。所有三种大语言模型在几何问题上都表现出明显的薄弱。DeepSeek-V3的主要错误是计算和逻辑错误，GPT-4o-mini常见逻辑和方法相关错误，而Gemini则倾向于不完整推理和草率结论。

Conclusion: 在代表性不足的数学竞赛数据集上评估大语言模型可以提供对其独特错误模式的深入见解，并突显在结构化推理方面，特别是在几何领域，仍然存在的挑战。

Abstract: Understanding the limitations of Large Language Models, or LLMs, in mathematical reasoning has been the focus of several recent studies. However, the majority of these studies use the same datasets for benchmarking, which limits the generalizability of their findings and may not fully capture the diverse challenges present in mathematical tasks. The purpose of the present study is to analyze the performance of LLMs on underrepresented mathematics competition problems. We prompted three leading LLMs, namely GPT-4o-mini, Gemini-2.0-Flash, and DeepSeek-V3, with the Missouri Collegiate Mathematics Competition problems in the areas of Calculus, Analytic Geometry, and Discrete Mathematics. The LLMs responses were then compared to the known correct solutions in order to determine the accuracy of the LLM for each problem domain. We also analyzed the LLMs reasoning to explore patterns in errors across problem types and models. DeepSeek-V3 has the best performance in all three categories of Calculus, Analytic Geometry, and Discrete Mathematics, both in reasoning and correct final answers. All three LLMs exhibited notably weak performance in Geometry. The majority of errors made by DeepSeek-V3 were attributed to computational and logical mistakes, whereas GPT-4o-mini frequently exhibited logical and approach-related errors. Gemini, on the other hand, tended to struggle with incomplete reasoning and drawing rushed conclusions. In conclusion, evaluating LLMs on underrepresented mathematics competition datasets can provide deeper insights into their distinct error patterns and highlight ongoing challenges in structured reasoning, particularly within the domain of Geometry.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种两阶段方法，将空间推理分解为原子构建块及其组合，通过监督微调学习基本空间变换，然后使用GRPO框架训练LoRA适配器进行多步规划，在ASCII艺术环境中优于基线方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管大语言模型在通用语言能力上表现出色，但在结构化环境中的空间变换和多步规划方面仍存在困难。需要开发能够有效处理空间推理任务的方法，特别是在导航和规划等应用中。

Method: 采用两阶段方法：1) 对基本空间变换（旋转、平移、缩放）进行监督微调，使模型具备基础空间物理知识；2) 冻结物理感知模型，在GRPO框架内训练轻量级LoRA适配器，以闭环方式学习将这些构建块组合用于谜题环境中的多步规划。为此合成了ASCII艺术数据集并构建了相应的ASCII强化学习环境。

Result: 该方法在动态环境（具有显式状态更新）和静态环境（模型必须依赖其内部状态）中均一致优于基线方法，包括通用骨干模型、物理感知模型和端到端RL模型。此外，与从零开始的端到端强化学习相比，收敛速度更快，训练更稳定。注意力模式分析表明微调确实带来了空间理解的有意义改进。

Conclusion: 通过将空间推理分解为原子构建块及其组合的两阶段方法，能够有效提升大语言模型在结构化环境中的空间推理能力。该方法不仅性能优越，而且训练更稳定高效，为空间推理任务提供了有前景的解决方案。

Abstract: Spatial reasoning in large language models (LLMs) has gained increasing attention due to applications in navigation and planning. Despite strong general language capabilities, LLMs still struggle with spatial transformations and multi-step planning in structured environments. We propose a two-stage approach that decomposes spatial reasoning into atomic building blocks and their composition. First, we apply supervised fine-tuning on elementary spatial transformations, such as rotation, translation, and scaling, to equip the model with basic spatial physics. We then freeze this physics-aware model and train lightweight LoRA adapters within the GRPO framework to learn policies that compose these building blocks for multi-step planning in puzzle-based environments, in a closed-loop manner. To support this pipeline, we synthesize an ASCII-art dataset and construct a corresponding ASCII-based reinforcement learning environment. Our method consistently outperforms baselines, including the generic backbone, physics-aware model, and end-to-end RL models, under both Dynamic environments with explicit state updates and Static environments where the model must rely on its internal state across steps. In addition, the proposed approach converges faster and exhibits more stable training compared to end-to-end reinforcement learning from scratch. Finally, we analyze attention patterns to assess whether fine-tuning induces meaningful improvements in spatial understanding.

Motivation: 解决大语言模型处理任意长提示的挑战，突破传统上下文窗口限制，实现更有效的长上下文处理

Method: 提出递归语言模型（RLMs）推理策略，将长提示视为外部环境，允许LLM程序化检查、分解提示片段，并递归调用自身处理这些片段

Result: RLMs成功处理超出模型上下文窗口两个数量级的输入，在四个不同的长上下文任务中，即使对于较短提示，也显著优于基础LLM和常见长上下文支架，同时查询成本相当或更低

Conclusion: 递归语言模型提供了一种有效处理超长提示的推理时扩展方法，在保持成本效益的同时显著提升长上下文处理质量

Abstract: We study allowing large language models (LLMs) to process arbitrarily long prompts through the lens of inference-time scaling. We propose Recursive Language Models (RLMs), a general inference strategy that treats long prompts as part of an external environment and allows the LLM to programmatically examine, decompose, and recursively call itself over snippets of the prompt. We find that RLMs successfully handle inputs up to two orders of magnitude beyond model context windows and, even for shorter prompts, dramatically outperform the quality of base LLMs and common long-context scaffolds across four diverse long-context tasks, while having comparable (or cheaper) cost per query.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) perform well in language tasks but often lack collaborative awareness and struggle to optimize global performance in multi-agent settings. We present a reinforcement learning-augmented LLM agent framework that formulates cooperation as a decentralized partially observable Markov decision process (Dec-POMDP) and adopts centralized training with decentralized execution (CTDE). We introduce Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) to jointly optimize agent policies with access to global signals during training, together with a simplified joint reward that balances task quality, speed, and coordination cost. On collaborative writing and coding benchmarks, our framework delivers a 3x increase in task processing speed over single-agent baselines, 98.7% structural/style consistency in writing, and a 74.6% test pass rate in coding. The approach consistently outperforms strong multi-agent LLM baselines and provides a practical path toward reliable collaboration in complex workflows.

Abstract: This paper proposes a group deliberation oriented multi-agent conversational model to address the limitations of single large language models in complex reasoning tasks. The model adopts a three-level role division architecture consisting of generation, verification, and integration. An opinion generation agent produces diverse reasoning perspectives, an evidence verification agent retrieves external knowledge and quantifies factual support, and a consistency arbitration agent integrates logically coherent conclusions. A self-game mechanism is introduced to expand multi-path reasoning trajectories, while a retrieval enhancement module dynamically supplements external knowledge. A composite reward function combining factual consistency and logical coherence is designed, and an improved proximal policy optimization strategy is applied for collaborative training. Experimental results show that the proposed model improves multi-hop reasoning accuracy by 16.8 percent on HotpotQA, 14.3 percent on 2WikiMultihopQA, and 19.2 percent on MeetingBank, while improving consistency by 21.5 percent. The model achieves higher reasoning efficiency than mainstream multi-agent approaches, providing an effective and stable solution for complex reasoning tasks.

Abstract: Existing Large Language Model (LLM) agent frameworks face two significant challenges: high configuration costs and static capabilities. Building a high-quality agent often requires extensive manual effort in tool integration and prompt engineering, while deployed agents struggle to adapt to dynamic environments without expensive fine-tuning. To address these issues, we propose \textbf{Youtu-Agent}, a modular framework designed for the automated generation and continuous evolution of LLM agents. Youtu-Agent features a structured configuration system that decouples execution environments, toolkits, and context management, enabling flexible reuse and automated synthesis. We introduce two generation paradigms: a \textbf{Workflow} mode for standard tasks and a \textbf{Meta-Agent} mode for complex, non-standard requirements, capable of automatically generating tool code, prompts, and configurations. Furthermore, Youtu-Agent establishes a hybrid policy optimization system: (1) an \textbf{Agent Practice} module that enables agents to accumulate experience and improve performance through in-context optimization without parameter updates; and (2) an \textbf{Agent RL} module that integrates with distributed training frameworks to enable scalable and stable reinforcement learning of any Youtu-Agents in an end-to-end, large-scale manner. Experiments demonstrate that Youtu-Agent achieves state-of-the-art performance on WebWalkerQA (71.47\%) and GAIA (72.8\%) using open-weight models. Our automated generation pipeline achieves over 81\% tool synthesis success rate, while the Practice module improves performance on AIME 2024/2025 by +2.7\% and +5.4\% respectively. Moreover, our Agent RL training achieves 40\% speedup with steady performance improvement on 7B LLMs, enhancing coding/reasoning and searching capabilities respectively up to 35\% and 21\% on Maths and general/multi-hop QA benchmarks.

Abstract: Intelligent fault diagnosis has become an indispensable technique for ensuring machinery reliability. However, existing methods suffer significant performance decline in real-world scenarios where models are tested under unseen working conditions, while domain adaptation approaches are limited to their reliance on target domain samples. Moreover, most existing studies rely on single-modal sensing signals, overlooking the complementary nature of multi-modal information for improving model generalization. To address these limitations, this paper proposes a multi-modal cross-domain mixed fusion model with dual disentanglement for fault diagnosis. A dual disentanglement framework is developed to decouple modality-invariant and modality-specific features, as well as domain-invariant and domain-specific representations, enabling both comprehensive multi-modal representation learning and robust domain generalization. A cross-domain mixed fusion strategy is designed to randomly mix modality information across domains for modality and domain diversity augmentation. Furthermore, a triple-modal fusion mechanism is introduced to adaptively integrate multi-modal heterogeneous information. Extensive experiments are conducted on induction motor fault diagnosis under both unseen constant and time-varying working conditions. The results demonstrate that the proposed method consistently outperforms advanced methods and comprehensive ablation studies further verify the effectiveness of each proposed component and multi-modal fusion.

TL;DR: 提出BatteryAgent框架，结合物理知识特征与大语言模型推理能力，实现锂离子电池故障的智能诊断与根因分析，超越传统黑盒深度学习方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有深度学习方法虽然检测精度高，但存在"黑盒"问题缺乏可解释性，且受限于二分类范式，无法提供根因分析和维护建议，限制了电池安全管理的实际应用。

Method: 提出三层框架：1) 物理感知层从电化学原理提取10个机理特征；2) 检测与归因层使用梯度提升决策树和SHAP量化特征贡献；3) 推理与诊断层利用LLM作为智能体核心，构建"数值-语义"桥梁，结合SHAP归因和机理知识库生成包含故障类型、根因分析和维护建议的综合报告。

Result: 实验结果显示BatteryAgent有效纠正了硬边界样本的误分类，AUROC达到0.986，显著优于当前最先进方法。框架将传统二分类检测扩展到多类型可解释诊断，实现了从"被动检测"到"智能诊断"的范式转变。

Conclusion: BatteryAgent通过整合物理知识与LLM推理能力，解决了现有方法在可解释性和根因分析方面的局限性，为电池安全管理提供了从被动检测到智能诊断的新范式。

Abstract: Fault diagnosis of lithium-ion batteries is critical for system safety. While existing deep learning methods exhibit superior detection accuracy, their "black-box" nature hinders interpretability. Furthermore, restricted by binary classification paradigms, they struggle to provide root cause analysis and maintenance recommendations. To address these limitations, this paper proposes BatteryAgent, a hierarchical framework that integrates physical knowledge features with the reasoning capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs). The framework comprises three core modules: (1) A Physical Perception Layer that utilizes 10 mechanism-based features derived from electrochemical principles, balancing dimensionality reduction with physical fidelity; (2) A Detection and Attribution Layer that employs Gradient Boosting Decision Trees and SHAP to quantify feature contributions; and (3) A Reasoning and Diagnosis Layer that leverages an LLM as the agent core. This layer constructs a "numerical-semantic" bridge, combining SHAP attributions with a mechanism knowledge base to generate comprehensive reports containing fault types, root cause analysis, and maintenance suggestions. Experimental results demonstrate that BatteryAgent effectively corrects misclassifications on hard boundary samples, achieving an AUROC of 0.986, which significantly outperforms current state-of-the-art methods. Moreover, the framework extends traditional binary detection to multi-type interpretable diagnosis, offering a new paradigm shift from "passive detection" to "intelligent diagnosis" for battery safety management.

Abstract: Robotic systems for household object rearrangement often rely on latent preference models inferred from human demonstrations. While effective at prediction, these models offer limited insight into the interpretable factors that guide human decisions. We introduce an explicit formulation of object arrangement preferences along four interpretable constructs: spatial practicality (putting items where they naturally fit best in the space), habitual convenience (making frequently used items easy to reach), semantic coherence (placing items together if they are used for the same task or are contextually related), and commonsense appropriateness (putting things where people would usually expect to find them). To capture these constructs, we designed and validated a self-report questionnaire through a 63-participant online study. Results confirm the psychological distinctiveness of these constructs and their explanatory power across two scenarios (kitchen and living room). We demonstrate the utility of these constructs by integrating them into a Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) planner and show that when guided by participant-derived preferences, our planner can generate reasonable arrangements that closely align with those generated by participants. This work contributes a compact, interpretable formulation of object arrangement preferences and a demonstration of how it can be operationalized for robot planning.

TL;DR: GenZ是一种混合模型，通过可解释的语义特征桥接基础模型与统计建模，利用统计建模误差发现数据集特定模式，而非仅依赖基础模型的领域知识。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型虽然拥有广泛的领域知识，但往往无法捕捉对预测任务至关重要的数据集特定模式。需要一种方法能够结合基础模型的语义理解能力和统计建模的数据驱动特性。

Method: 通过迭代过程发现语义特征描述：基于统计建模误差对比项目组，而非仅依赖基础模型的领域理解。将其形式化为广义EM算法，联合优化语义特征描述符和统计模型参数。使用冻结的基础模型基于发现的特征对项目进行分类，将这些判断视为预测实值目标的潜在二元特征的噪声观测。

Result: 在房价预测中，模型使用多模态列表数据发现的语义特征实现12%的中位数相对误差，显著优于依赖LLM通用领域知识的GPT-5基线（38%误差）。在Netflix电影嵌入预测中，模型仅从语义描述就能以0.59余弦相似度预测协同过滤表示，匹配传统协同过滤需要约4000用户评分才能达到的性能。

Conclusion: GenZ成功桥接了基础模型和统计建模，通过可解释的语义特征发现数据集特定模式（如预测本地房地产市场的建筑细节、预测用户偏好的系列成员资格），这些模式与模型单独依赖的领域知识存在差异，证明了混合方法的有效性。

Abstract: We present GenZ, a hybrid model that bridges foundational models and statistical modeling through interpretable semantic features. While large language models possess broad domain knowledge, they often fail to capture dataset-specific patterns critical for prediction tasks. Our approach addresses this by discovering semantic feature descriptions through an iterative process that contrasts groups of items identified via statistical modeling errors, rather than relying solely on the foundational model's domain understanding. We formulate this as a generalized EM algorithm that jointly optimizes semantic feature descriptors and statistical model parameters. The method prompts a frozen foundational model to classify items based on discovered features, treating these judgments as noisy observations of latent binary features that predict real-valued targets through learned statistical relationships. We demonstrate the approach on two domains: house price prediction (hedonic regression) and cold-start collaborative filtering for movie recommendations. On house prices, our model achieves 12\% median relative error using discovered semantic features from multimodal listing data, substantially outperforming a GPT-5 baseline (38\% error) that relies on the LLM's general domain knowledge. For Netflix movie embeddings, our model predicts collaborative filtering representations with 0.59 cosine similarity purely from semantic descriptions -- matching the performance that would require approximately 4000 user ratings through traditional collaborative filtering. The discovered features reveal dataset-specific patterns (e.g., architectural details predicting local housing markets, franchise membership predicting user preferences) that diverge from the model's domain knowledge alone.

Motivation: 养老机构的排班条件因设施而异，需要通过与制定排班表的管理者访谈来设计设施特定的约束条件。现有约束提取技术缺乏排除异常约束的机制。

Method: 使用约束模板提取各种组件的组合，如连续工作日的班次模式或员工组合。模板可通过改变关注的天数和员工数量，以及将提取重点改为模式或频率来提取多种约束。研究还包含排除异常约束的机制。

Result: 实验表明，提出的方法成功创建了满足所有硬约束的排班表，并通过避免提取异常约束，减少了软约束的违反次数。

Conclusion: 该方法能够有效提取养老机构特定的排班约束条件，生成满足约束的护理人员排班表，解决了传统方法难以处理设施差异和异常约束的问题。

Abstract: Technologies for automatically generating work schedules have been extensively studied; however, in long-term care facilities, the conditions vary between facilities, making it essential to interview the managers who create shift schedules to design facility-specific constraint conditions. The proposed method utilizes constraint templates to extract combinations of various components, such as shift patterns for consecutive days or staff combinations. The templates can extract a variety of constraints by changing the number of days and the number of staff members to focus on and changing the extraction focus to patterns or frequency. In addition, unlike existing constraint extraction techniques, this study incorporates mechanisms to exclude exceptional constraints. The extracted constraints can be employed by a constraint programming solver to create care worker schedules. Experiments demonstrated that our proposed method successfully created schedules that satisfied all hard constraints and reduced the number of violations for soft constraints by circumventing the extraction of exceptional constraints.

Abstract: This report presents the design and implementation of a semi-automated data annotation pipeline developed within the DARTS project, whose goal is to create a large-scale, multimodal dataset of driving scenarios recorded in Polish conditions. Manual annotation of such heterogeneous data is both costly and time-consuming. To address this challenge, the proposed solution adopts a human-in-the-loop approach that combines artificial intelligence with human expertise to reduce annotation cost and duration. The system automatically generates initial annotations, enables iterative model retraining, and incorporates data anonymization and domain adaptation techniques. At its core, the tool relies on 3D object detection algorithms to produce preliminary annotations. Overall, the developed tools and methodology result in substantial time savings while ensuring consistent, high-quality annotations across different sensor modalities. The solution directly supports the DARTS project by accelerating the preparation of large annotated dataset in the project's standardized format, strengthening the technological base for autonomous vehicle research in Poland.

TL;DR: 迭代部署LLM并通过用户数据筛选进行微调，能显著改变模型特性，在规划任务中实现技能提升和泛化能力，其机制相当于隐式强化学习。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究迭代部署大型语言模型（LLM）时，用户从先前模型部署中精心筛选数据进行微调，如何影响后续模型特性。探索这种部署机制对模型能力演化的影响，特别是与强化学习的理论联系及其对AI安全的意义。

Method: 采用迭代部署机制：1）部署LLM；2）用户从模型输出中筛选高质量数据；3）用筛选数据微调新模型；4）重复此过程。在多个规划领域测试该方法，观察模型规划能力的变化。同时进行理论分析，证明迭代部署实现了隐式强化学习的外循环训练。

Result: 在规划任务中观察到显著改进：后续模型展现出规划技能的实质性提升，能够发现比初始模型长得多的规划方案，表现出新兴的泛化能力。理论分析表明迭代部署实现了隐式强化学习，其奖励函数由用户数据筛选过程隐式定义。

Conclusion: 迭代部署机制通过用户数据筛选实现了隐式强化学习训练，能显著提升模型能力并引发泛化。这对AI安全有重要启示：隐式奖励函数可能导致未来模型部署出现意外特性。同时，该方法可作为显式强化学习的替代训练机制，依赖数据筛选而非显式奖励。

Abstract: We show that iterative deployment of large language models (LLMs), each fine-tuned on data carefully curated by users from the previous models' deployment, can significantly change the properties of the resultant models. By testing this mechanism on various planning domains, we observe substantial improvements in planning skills, with later models displaying emergent generalization by discovering much longer plans than the initial models. We then provide theoretical analysis showing that iterative deployment effectively implements reinforcement learning (RL) training in the outer-loop (i.e. not as part of intentional model training), with an implicit reward function. The connection to RL has two important implications: first, for the field of AI safety, as the reward function entailed by repeated deployment is not defined explicitly, and could have unexpected implications to the properties of future model deployments. Second, the mechanism highlighted here can be viewed as an alternative training regime to explicit RL, relying on data curation rather than explicit rewards.

Abstract: We present STAgent, an agentic large language model tailored for spatio-temporal understanding, designed to solve complex tasks such as constrained point-of-interest discovery and itinerary planning. STAgent is a specialized model capable of interacting with ten distinct tools within spatio-temporal scenarios, enabling it to explore, verify, and refine intermediate steps during complex reasoning. Notably, STAgent effectively preserves its general capabilities. We empower STAgent with these capabilities through three key contributions: (1) a stable tool environment that supports over ten domain-specific tools, enabling asynchronous rollout and training; (2) a hierarchical data curation framework that identifies high-quality data like a needle in a haystack, curating high-quality queries with a filter ratio of 1:10,000, emphasizing both diversity and difficulty; and (3) a cascaded training recipe that starts with a seed SFT stage acting as a guardian to measure query difficulty, followed by a second SFT stage fine-tuned on queries with high certainty, and an ultimate RL stage that leverages data of low certainty. Initialized with Qwen3-30B-A3B to establish a strong SFT foundation and leverage insights into sample difficulty, STAgent yields promising performance on TravelBench while maintaining its general capabilities across a wide range of general benchmarks, thereby demonstrating the effectiveness of our proposed agentic model.
