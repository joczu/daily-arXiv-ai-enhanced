Existing methods often address isolated sub-problems such as cyanobacteria, chlorophyll, or other quality indicators separately. NAIAD introduces an agentic AI assistant that leverages Large Language Models (LLMs) and external analytical tools to deliver a holistic solution for inland water monitoring using Earth Observation (EO) data. Designed for both experts and non-experts, NAIAD provides a single-prompt interface that translates natural-language queries into actionable insights. Through Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), LLM reasoning, external tool orchestration, computational graph execution, and agentic reflection, it retrieves and synthesizes knowledge from curated sources to produce tailored reports. The system integrates diverse tools for weather data, Sentinel-2 imagery, remote-sensing index computation (e.g., NDCI), chlorophyll-a estimation, and established platforms such as CyFi. Performance is evaluated using correctness and relevancy metrics, achieving over 77% and 85% respectively on a dedicated benchmark covering multiple user-expertise levels.

In this study, we propose an ontology-guided, equation-centric framework that tightly integrates large language models (LLMs) with an additive manufacturing mathematical knowledge graph (AM-MKG) to enable reliable knowledge extraction and principled extrapolative modeling. By explicitly encoding equations, variables, assumptions, and their semantic relationships within a formal ontology, unstructured literature is transformed into machine-interpretable representations that support structured querying and reasoning. LLM-based equation generation is further conditioned on MKG-derived subgraphs, enforcing physically meaningful functional forms and mitigating non-physical or unstable extrapolation trends. To assess reliability beyond conventional predictive uncertainty, a confidence-aware extrapolation assessment is introduced, integrating extrapolation distance, statistical stability, and knowledge-graph-based physical consistency into a unified confidence score. Results demonstrate that ontology-guided extraction significantly improves the structural coherence and quantitative reliability of extracted knowledge, while subgraph-conditioned equation generation yields stable and physically consistent extrapolations compared to unguided LLM outputs.

Although recent studies suggest that assigning personality traits to LLMs can influence their behavior, how personality steering affects cooperation under controlled conditions remains unclear. In this study, we examine the effects of personality steering on cooperative behavior in LLM agents using repeated Prisoner's Dilemma games. Based on the Big Five framework, we first measure basic personality profiles of three models, GPT-3.5-turbo, GPT-4o, and GPT-5, using the Big Five Inventory. We then compare behavior under baseline and personality-informed conditions, and further analyze the effects of independently manipulating each personality dimension to extreme values. Our results show that agreeableness is the dominant factor promoting cooperation across all models, while other personality traits have limited impact. Explicit personality information increases cooperation but can also raise vulnerability to exploitation, particularly in earlier-generation models. In contrast, later-generation models exhibit more selective cooperation. These findings indicate that personality steering acts as a behavioral bias rather than a deterministic control mechanism.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76\u901a\u8fc7\u91cd\u590d\u56da\u5f92\u56f0\u5883\u5b9e\u9a8c\uff0c\u63a2\u7a76\u4eba\u683c\u5f15\u5bfc\u5bf9LLM\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u5408\u4f5c\u884c\u4e3a\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u5b9c\u4eba\u6027\u662f\u4fc3\u8fdb\u5408\u4f5c\u7684\u4e3b\u8981\u56e0\u7d20\uff0c\u4eba\u683c\u5f15\u5bfc\u66f4\u591a\u662f\u884c\u4e3a\u504f\u5dee\u800c\u975e\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u63a7\u5236\u673a\u5236\u3002", "motivation": "\u5c3d\u7ba1\u5df2\u6709\u7814\u7a76\u8868\u660e\u4e3a\u4eba\u683c\u7279\u8d28\u53ef\u4ee5\u5f71\u54cdLLM\u884c\u4e3a\uff0c\u4f46\u4eba\u683c\u5f15\u5bfc\u5728\u53d7\u63a7\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u5982\u4f55\u5f71\u54cd\u5408\u4f5c\u884c\u4e3a\u4ecd\u4e0d\u6e05\u695a\u3002\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u65e8\u5728\u63a2\u7a76\u4eba\u683c\u5f15\u5bfc\u5bf9LLM\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u5728\u6218\u7565\u4e92\u52a8\u4e2d\u5408\u4f5c\u884c\u4e3a\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u3002", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528\u91cd\u590d\u56da\u5f92\u56f0\u5883\u6e38\u620f\uff0c\u57fa\u4e8e\u5927\u4e94\u4eba\u683c\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u9996\u5148\u6d4b\u91cfGPT-3.5-turbo\u3001GPT-4o\u548cGPT-5\u7684\u57fa\u672c\u4eba\u683c\u7279\u5f81\uff0c\u7136\u540e\u6bd4\u8f83\u57fa\u7ebf\u548c\u4eba\u683c\u5f15\u5bfc\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u7684\u884c\u4e3a\uff0c\u5e76\u5206\u6790\u72ec\u7acb\u64cd\u7eb5\u5404\u4eba\u683c\u7ef4\u5ea6\u5230\u6781\u7aef\u503c\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u3002", "result": "\u5b9c\u4eba\u6027\u662f\u6240\u6709\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\u4fc3\u8fdb\u5408\u4f5c\u7684\u4e3b\u5bfc\u56e0\u7d20\uff0c\u5176\u4ed6\u4eba\u683c\u7279\u8d28\u5f71\u54cd\u6709\u9650\u3002\u660e\u786e\u7684\u4eba\u683c\u4fe1\u606f\u589e\u52a0\u5408\u4f5c\uff0c\u4f46\u4e5f\u589e\u52a0\u88ab\u5229\u7528\u7684\u8106\u5f31\u6027\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5728\u65e9\u671f\u4ee3\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\u3002\u540e\u671f\u4ee3\u6a21\u578b\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u66f4\u5177\u9009\u62e9\u6027\u7684\u5408\u4f5c\u3002", "conclusion": "\u4eba\u683c\u5f15\u5bfc\u66f4\u591a\u662f\u4f5c\u4e3a\u884c\u4e3a\u504f\u5dee\u800c\u975e\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u63a7\u5236\u673a\u5236\u3002\u5b9c\u4eba\u6027\u662f\u4fc3\u8fdb\u5408\u4f5c\u7684\u5173\u952e\u56e0\u7d20\uff0c\u4f46\u4eba\u683c\u5f15\u5bfc\u7684\u6548\u679c\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u4ee3\u6a21\u578b\u95f4\u5b58\u5728\u5dee\u5f02\uff0c\u540e\u671f\u6a21\u578b\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u66f4\u590d\u6742\u7684\u5408\u4f5c\u7b56\u7565\u3002"}}

While existing methods could leverage databases of expert-curated enzyme-substrate pairs for models to learn from known pair interactions, the databases are often sparse, i.e., there are only limited and incomplete examples of such pairs, and also labor-intensive to maintain. This lack of sufficient training data significantly hinders the ability of traditional enzyme prediction models to generalize to unseen interactions. In this work, we try to exploit chemical reaction equations from domain-specific databases, given their easier accessibility and denser, more abundant data. However, interactions of multiple compounds, e.g., educts and products, with the same enzymes create complex relational data patterns that traditional models cannot easily capture. To tackle that, we represent chemical reaction equations as triples of (educt, enzyme, product) within a knowledge graph, such that we can take advantage of knowledge graph embedding (KGE) to infer missing enzyme-substrate pairs for graph completion. Particularly, in order to capture intricate relationships among compounds, we propose our knowledge-enhanced hypergraph model for enzyme prediction, i.e., Hyper-Enz, which integrates a hypergraph transformer with a KGE model to learn representations of the hyper-edges that involve multiple educts and products. Also, a multi-expert paradigm is introduced to guide the learning of enzyme-substrate interactions with both the proposed model and chemical reaction equations. Experimental results show a significant improvement, with up to a 88% relative improvement in average enzyme retrieval accuracy and 30% improvement in pair-level prediction compared to traditional models, demonstrating the effectiveness of our approach.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51faHyper-Enz\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u77e5\u8bc6\u56fe\u8c31\u5d4c\u5165\u548c\u8d85\u56fe\u53d8\u6362\u5668\u9884\u6d4b\u9176-\u5e95\u7269\u76f8\u4e92\u4f5c\u7528\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u5316\u5b66\u53cd\u5e94\u65b9\u7a0b\u6784\u5efa\u4e09\u5143\u7ec4\u77e5\u8bc6\u56fe\u8c31\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u9176\u9884\u6d4b\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u9176-\u5e95\u7269\u76f8\u4e92\u4f5c\u7528\u9884\u6d4b\u662f\u751f\u7269\u5316\u5b66\u548c\u4ee3\u8c22\u5de5\u7a0b\u7684\u57fa\u7840\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u4f46\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u9762\u4e34\u8bad\u7ec3\u6570\u636e\u7a00\u758f\u3001\u7ef4\u62a4\u6210\u672c\u9ad8\u7684\u95ee\u9898\u3002\u4f20\u7edf\u6a21\u578b\u56e0\u7f3a\u4e4f\u8db3\u591f\u8bad\u7ec3\u6570\u636e\u800c\u96be\u4ee5\u6cdb\u5316\u5230\u672a\u89c1\u76f8\u4e92\u4f5c\u7528\u3002\u5316\u5b66\u53cd\u5e94\u65b9\u7a0b\u6570\u636e\u5e93\u66f4\u6613\u83b7\u53d6\u4e14\u6570\u636e\u66f4\u4e30\u5bcc\uff0c\u4f46\u591a\u5316\u5408\u7269\u4e0e\u540c\u4e00\u9176\u7684\u76f8\u4e92\u4f5c\u7528\u5f62\u6210\u590d\u6742\u5173\u7cfb\u6a21\u5f0f\uff0c\u4f20\u7edf\u6a21\u578b\u96be\u4ee5\u6355\u6349\u3002", "method": "\u5c06\u5316\u5b66\u53cd\u5e94\u65b9\u7a0b\u8868\u793a\u4e3a(\u5e95\u7269\u3001\u9176\u3001\u4ea7\u7269)\u4e09\u5143\u7ec4\u6784\u5efa\u77e5\u8bc6\u56fe\u8c31\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u77e5\u8bc6\u56fe\u8c31\u5d4c\u5165(KGE)\u8fdb\u884c\u56fe\u8865\u5168\u3002\u63d0\u51faHyper-Enz\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u96c6\u6210\u8d85\u56fe\u53d8\u6362\u5668\u548cKGE\u6a21\u578b\u5b66\u4e60\u6d89\u53ca\u591a\u4e2a\u5e95\u7269\u548c\u4ea7\u7269\u7684\u8d85\u8fb9\u8868\u793a\u3002\u5f15\u5165\u591a\u4e13\u5bb6\u8303\u5f0f\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u6a21\u578b\u548c\u5316\u5b66\u53cd\u5e94\u65b9\u7a0b\u6307\u5bfc\u9176-\u5e95\u7269\u76f8\u4e92\u4f5c\u7528\u5b66\u4e60\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u7ed3\u679c\u663e\u793a\u663e\u8457\u6539\u8fdb\uff1a\u9176\u68c0\u7d22\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u76f8\u5bf9\u63d0\u5347\u9ad8\u8fbe88%\uff0c\u914d\u5bf9\u7ea7\u9884\u6d4b\u63d0\u534730%\uff0c\u4f18\u4e8e\u4f20\u7edf\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u8bc1\u660e\u4e86\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "Hyper-Enz\u6a21\u578b\u901a\u8fc7\u77e5\u8bc6\u56fe\u8c31\u5d4c\u5165\u548c\u8d85\u56fe\u53d8\u6362\u5668\u6709\u6548\u6355\u6349\u9176-\u5e95\u7269\u76f8\u4e92\u4f5c\u7528\u7684\u590d\u6742\u5173\u7cfb\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u5316\u5b66\u53cd\u5e94\u65b9\u7a0b\u6570\u636e\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u4f20\u7edf\u65b9\u6cd5\u6570\u636e\u7a00\u758f\u7684\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u9176\u9884\u6d4b\u6027\u80fd\u3002"}}

Each datapoint includes a personal vote (first-order signal) and a meta-prediction of how others will vote (second-order signal), allowing richer modeling than traditional datasets that capture only individual preferences. SP-Rank contains over 12,000 human-generated datapoints across three domains -- geography, movies, and paintings, and spans nine elicitation formats with varying subset sizes. This structure enables empirical analysis of preference aggregation when expert identities are unknown but presumed to exist, and individual votes represent noisy estimates of a shared ground-truth ranking. We benchmark SP-Rank by comparing traditional aggregation methods that use only first-order votes against SP-Voting, a second-order method that jointly reasons over both signals to infer ground-truth rankings. While SP-Rank also supports models that rely solely on second-order predictions, our benchmarks emphasize the gains from combining both signals. We evaluate performance across three core tasks: (1) full ground-truth rank recovery, (2) subset-level rank recovery, and (3) probabilistic modeling of voter behavior. Results show that incorporating second-order signals substantially improves accuracy over vote-only methods. Beyond social choice, SP-Rank supports downstream applications in learning-to-rank, extracting expert knowledge from noisy crowds, and training reward models in preference-based fine-tuning pipelines.

However, its effects on high-stakes clinical decision-making remain poorly characterized. We systematically evaluate persona-based control in clinical LLMs, examining how professional roles (e.g., Emergency Department physician, nurse) and interaction styles (bold vs.\\ cautious) influence behavior across models and medical tasks. We assess performance on clinical triage and patient-safety tasks using multidimensional evaluations that capture task accuracy, calibration, and safety-relevant risk behavior. We find systematic, context-dependent, and non-monotonic effects: Medical personas improve performance in critical care tasks, yielding gains of up to $\\sim+20\\%$ in accuracy and calibration, but degrade performance in primary-care settings by comparable margins. Interaction style modulates risk propensity and sensitivity, but it's highly model-dependent. While aggregated LLM-judge rankings favor medical over non-medical personas in safety-critical cases, we found that human clinicians show moderate agreement on safety compliance (average Cohen's $\u03ba= 0.43$) but indicate a low confidence in 95.9\\% of their responses on reasoning quality. Our work shows that personas function as behavioral priors that introduce context-dependent trade-offs rather than guarantees of safety or expertise.

However, traditional RAG methods rely on fragment-level retrieval, limiting their ability to address query-focused summarization queries. GraphRAG introduces a graph-based paradigm for global knowledge reasoning, yet suffers from inefficiencies in information extraction, costly resource consumption, and poor adaptability to incremental updates. To overcome these limitations, we propose TagRAG, a tag-guided hierarchical knowledge graph RAG framework designed for efficient global reasoning and scalable graph maintenance. TagRAG introduces two key components: (1) Tag Knowledge Graph Construction, which extracts object tags and their relationships from documents and organizes them into hierarchical domain tag chains for structured knowledge representation, and (2) Tag-Guided Retrieval-Augmented Generation, which retrieves domain-centric tag chains to localize and synthesize relevant knowledge during inference. This design significantly adapts to smaller language models, improves retrieval granularity, and supports efficient knowledge increment. Extensive experiments on UltraDomain datasets spanning Agriculture, Computer Science, Law, and cross-domain settings demonstrate that TagRAG achieves an average win rate of 95.41\\% against baselines while maintaining about 14.6x construction and 1.9x retrieval efficiency compared with GraphRAG.", "AI": {"tldr": "TagRAG\uff1a\u4e00\u79cd\u6807\u7b7e\u5f15\u5bfc\u7684\u5206\u5c42\u77e5\u8bc6\u56fe\u8c31RAG\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6784\u5efa\u5206\u5c42\u9886\u57df\u6807\u7b7e\u94fe\u6765\u63d0\u5347\u5168\u5c40\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u76f8\u6bd4\u4f20\u7edfRAG\u548cGraphRAG\u5728\u6548\u7387\u548c\u9002\u5e94\u6027\u4e0a\u6709\u663e\u8457\u6539\u8fdb", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edfRAG\u65b9\u6cd5\u4f9d\u8d56\u7247\u6bb5\u7ea7\u68c0\u7d22\uff0c\u96be\u4ee5\u5904\u7406\u67e5\u8be2\u805a\u7126\u7684\u6458\u8981\u4efb\u52a1\uff1bGraphRAG\u867d\u7136\u5f15\u5165\u56fe\u5f0f\u5168\u5c40\u63a8\u7406\uff0c\u4f46\u5b58\u5728\u4fe1\u606f\u63d0\u53d6\u6548\u7387\u4f4e\u3001\u8d44\u6e90\u6d88\u8017\u5927\u3001\u589e\u91cf\u66f4\u65b0\u9002\u5e94\u6027\u5dee\u7b49\u95ee\u9898", "method": "\u63d0\u51faTagRAG\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5305\u542b\u4e24\u4e2a\u6838\u5fc3\u7ec4\u4ef6\uff1a1) \u6807\u7b7e\u77e5\u8bc6\u56fe\u8c31\u6784\u5efa\uff1a\u4ece\u6587\u6863\u4e2d\u63d0\u53d6\u5bf9\u8c61\u6807\u7b7e\u53ca\u5176\u5173\u7cfb\uff0c\u7ec4\u7ec7\u6210\u5206\u5c42\u9886\u57df\u6807\u7b7e\u94fe\uff1b2) \u6807\u7b7e\u5f15\u5bfc\u7684\u68c0\u7d22\u589e\u5f3a\u751f\u6210\uff1a\u68c0\u7d22\u9886\u57df\u4e2d\u5fc3\u7684\u6807\u7b7e\u94fe\u4ee5\u5b9a\u4f4d\u548c\u5408\u6210\u76f8\u5173\u77e5\u8bc6", "result": "\u5728UltraDomain\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff08\u519c\u4e1a\u3001\u8ba1\u7b97\u673a\u79d1\u5b66\u3001\u6cd5\u5f8b\u53ca\u8de8\u9886\u57df\uff09\u4e0a\u7684\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0cTagRAG\u76f8\u5bf9\u4e8e\u57fa\u7ebf\u65b9\u6cd5\u5e73\u5747\u80dc\u7387\u8fbe\u523095.41%\uff0c\u6784\u5efa\u6548\u7387\u6bd4GraphRAG\u63d0\u5347\u7ea614.6\u500d\uff0c\u68c0\u7d22\u6548\u7387\u63d0\u5347\u7ea61.9\u500d", "conclusion": "TagRAG\u901a\u8fc7\u6807\u7b7e\u5f15\u5bfc\u7684\u5206\u5c42\u77e5\u8bc6\u56fe\u8c31\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86RAG\u7684\u5168\u5c40\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\u3001\u68c0\u7d22\u7c92\u5ea6\u3001\u5bf9\u5c0f\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u9002\u5e94\u6027\u4ee5\u53ca\u77e5\u8bc6\u589e\u91cf\u6548\u7387\uff0c\u4e3a\u9ad8\u6548\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u7684\u68c0\u7d22\u589e\u5f3a\u751f\u6210\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u8303\u5f0f"}}

The result is a two-tier schema comprising 38 elementary bias types, arranged in six functional families and visualised as a \"table of media-bias elements\". For each type we supply a definition, real-world examples, cognitive and societal drivers, and guidance for recognition.

This study examines conformity, the tendency to align with group opinions under social pressure, in large multimodal language models functioning as AI agents. By adapting classic visual experiments from social psychology, we investigate how AI agents respond to group influence as social actors. Our experiments reveal that AI agents exhibit a systematic conformity bias, aligned with Social Impact Theory, showing sensitivity to group size, unanimity, task difficulty, and source characteristics. Critically, AI agents achieving near-perfect performance in isolation become highly susceptible to manipulation through social influence. This vulnerability persists across model scales: while larger models show reduced conformity on simple tasks due to improved capabilities, they remain vulnerable when operating at their competence boundary. These findings reveal fundamental security vulnerabilities in AI agent decision-making that could enable malicious manipulation, misinformation campaigns, and bias propagation in multi-agent systems, highlighting the urgent need for safeguards in collective AI deployments.", "AI": {"tldr": "AI\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u5728\u7fa4\u4f53\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u7cfb\u7edf\u6027\u4ece\u4f17\u504f\u5dee\uff0c\u7b26\u5408\u793e\u4f1a\u5f71\u54cd\u7406\u8bba\uff0c\u5373\u4f7f\u5b64\u7acb\u65f6\u6027\u80fd\u63a5\u8fd1\u5b8c\u7f8e\u7684\u6a21\u578b\u4e5f\u4f1a\u53d7\u5230\u793e\u4f1a\u5f71\u54cd\u64cd\u7eb5\uff0c\u8fd9\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u7684\u5b89\u5168\u6f0f\u6d1e", "motivation": "\u968f\u7740AI\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u8d8a\u6765\u8d8a\u591a\u5730\u5728\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u8fd0\u884c\uff0c\u7406\u89e3\u5b83\u4eec\u7684\u96c6\u4f53\u884c\u4e3a\u5bf9\u4e8e\u9884\u6d4b\u4eba\u5de5\u793e\u4f1a\u7684\u52a8\u6001\u53d8\u5f97\u81f3\u5173\u91cd\u8981\u3002\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u65e8\u5728\u63a2\u7d22\u5927\u578b\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u4f5c\u4e3aAI\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u65f6\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u7684\u4ece\u4f17\u884c\u4e3a\uff08\u5728\u7fa4\u4f53\u538b\u529b\u4e0b\u4e0e\u7fa4\u4f53\u610f\u89c1\u4fdd\u6301\u4e00\u81f4\u7684\u8d8b\u52bf\uff09\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u6539\u7f16\u793e\u4f1a\u5fc3\u7406\u5b66\u4e2d\u7684\u7ecf\u5178\u89c6\u89c9\u5b9e\u9a8c\uff0c\u7814\u7a76AI\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u4f5c\u4e3a\u793e\u4f1a\u884c\u52a8\u8005\u5982\u4f55\u54cd\u5e94\u7fa4\u4f53\u5f71\u54cd\u3002\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8003\u5bdf\u4e86\u7fa4\u4f53\u89c4\u6a21\u3001\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u3001\u4efb\u52a1\u96be\u5ea6\u548c\u6765\u6e90\u7279\u5f81\u7b49\u56e0\u7d20\u5bf9AI\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u4ece\u4f17\u884c\u4e3a\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u3002", "result": "AI\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u7cfb\u7edf\u6027\u4ece\u4f17\u504f\u5dee\uff0c\u7b26\u5408\u793e\u4f1a\u5f71\u54cd\u7406\u8bba\uff0c\u5bf9\u7fa4\u4f53\u89c4\u6a21\u3001\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u3001\u4efb\u52a1\u96be\u5ea6\u548c\u6765\u6e90\u7279\u5f81\u654f\u611f\u3002\u5b64\u7acb\u65f6\u6027\u80fd\u63a5\u8fd1\u5b8c\u7f8e\u7684AI\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u53d8\u5f97\u9ad8\u5ea6\u6613\u53d7\u793e\u4f1a\u5f71\u54cd\u64cd\u7eb5\u3002\u8fd9\u79cd\u8106\u5f31\u6027\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u6a21\u578b\u89c4\u6a21\u4e0a\u6301\u7eed\u5b58\u5728\uff1a\u867d\u7136\u5927\u578b\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u7b80\u5355\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u56e0\u80fd\u529b\u63d0\u5347\u800c\u51cf\u5c11\u4ece\u4f17\uff0c\u4f46\u5728\u5176\u80fd\u529b\u8fb9\u754c\u64cd\u4f5c\u65f6\u4ecd\u7136\u8106\u5f31\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8fd9\u4e9b\u53d1\u73b0\u63ed\u793a\u4e86AI\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u51b3\u7b56\u4e2d\u7684\u57fa\u672c\u5b89\u5168\u6f0f\u6d1e\uff0c\u53ef\u80fd\u4f7f\u6076\u610f\u64cd\u7eb5\u3001\u865a\u5047\u4fe1\u606f\u4f20\u64ad\u548c\u504f\u89c1\u5728\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u6269\u6563\uff0c\u7a81\u663e\u4e86\u5728\u96c6\u4f53AI\u90e8\u7f72\u4e2d\u8feb\u5207\u9700\u8981\u5b89\u5168\u9632\u62a4\u63aa\u65bd\u3002"}}

By design, the interface shows only grounded passages, never free text, keeping evidence verifiable and auditable. This need is acute in India, where judgments and cross-examinations are notoriously long.In a pilot on representative charge sheets, pleadings, and orders, median time-to-relevance drops from 3-5 minutes (manual navigation) to 10-15 seconds; with quick visual verification included, 30-45 seconds.

Since their training data are largely derived from human-authored corpora, LLMs may inherit a range of human biases. Behavioral biases can lead to instability and uncertainty in decision-making, particularly when processing financial information. However, existing research on LLM bias has mainly focused on direct questioning or simplified, general-purpose settings, with limited consideration of the complex real-world financial environments and high-risk, context-sensitive, multilingual financial misinformation detection tasks (\\mfmd). In this work, we propose \\mfmdscen, a comprehensive benchmark for evaluating behavioral biases of LLMs in \\mfmd across diverse economic scenarios. In collaboration with financial experts, we construct three types of complex financial scenarios: (i) role- and personality-based, (ii) role- and region-based, and (iii) role-based scenarios incorporating ethnicity and religious beliefs. We further develop a multilingual financial misinformation dataset covering English, Chinese, Greek, and Bengali. By integrating these scenarios with misinformation claims, \\mfmdscen enables a systematic evaluation of 22 mainstream LLMs. Our findings reveal that pronounced behavioral biases persist across both commercial and open-source models.

In this paper, we propose ART (Adaptive Reasoning Trees), a hierarchical method for claim verification. The process begins with a root claim, which branches into supporting and attacking child arguments. An argument's strength is determined bottom-up via a pairwise tournament of its children, adjudicated by a judge LLM, allowing a final, transparent and contestable verdict to be systematically derived which is missing in methods like Chain-of-Thought (CoT). We empirically validate ART on multiple datasets, analyzing different argument generators and comparison strategies.

To improve user experience, an effective trending query detection method is urgently needed to enable differentiated processing of such target traffic. However, current research on trending detection tailored to the dialogue system scenario remains largely unexplored, and methods designed for traditional search engines often underperform in conversational contexts due to radically distinct query distributions and expression patterns. To fill this gap, we propose a multi-stage framework for trending detection, which achieves systematic optimization from both offline generation and online identification perspectives. Specifically, our framework first exploits selected hot events to generate index queries, establishing a key bridge between static events and dynamic user queries. It then employs a retrieval matching mechanism for real-time online detection of trending queries, where we introduce a cascaded recall and ranking architecture to balance detection efficiency and accuracy. Furthermore, to better adapt to the practical application scenario, our framework adopts a single-recall module as a cold-start strategy to collect online data for fine-tuning the reranker. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our framework significantly outperforms baseline methods in both offline evaluations and online A/B tests, and user satisfaction is relatively improved by 27\\% in terms of positive-negative feedback ratio.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u7528\u4e8e\u5bf9\u8bdd\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u591a\u9636\u6bb5\u8d8b\u52bf\u67e5\u8be2\u68c0\u6d4b\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u79bb\u7ebf\u751f\u6210\u548c\u5728\u7ebf\u8bc6\u522b\u5b9e\u73b0\u7cfb\u7edf\u4f18\u5316\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u7528\u6237\u6ee1\u610f\u5ea6", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u804a\u5929\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u96be\u4ee5\u6709\u6548\u5904\u7406\u65b0\u95fb\u76f8\u5173\u8d8b\u52bf\u67e5\u8be2\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u9488\u5bf9\u5bf9\u8bdd\u7cfb\u7edf\u573a\u666f\u7684\u8d8b\u52bf\u68c0\u6d4b\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u4f20\u7edf\u641c\u7d22\u5f15\u64ce\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u5bf9\u8bdd\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u4e0d\u4f73", "method": "\u591a\u9636\u6bb5\u6846\u67b6\uff1a1) \u5229\u7528\u70ed\u70b9\u4e8b\u4ef6\u751f\u6210\u7d22\u5f15\u67e5\u8be2\uff1b2) \u91c7\u7528\u68c0\u7d22\u5339\u914d\u673a\u5236\u8fdb\u884c\u5b9e\u65f6\u5728\u7ebf\u68c0\u6d4b\uff1b3) \u5f15\u5165\u7ea7\u8054\u53ec\u56de\u548c\u6392\u5e8f\u67b6\u6784\u5e73\u8861\u6548\u7387\u4e0e\u7cbe\u5ea6\uff1b4) \u4f7f\u7528\u5355\u53ec\u56de\u6a21\u5757\u4f5c\u4e3a\u51b7\u542f\u52a8\u7b56\u7565\u6536\u96c6\u6570\u636e\u5fae\u8c03\u91cd\u6392\u5e8f\u5668", "result": "\u6846\u67b6\u5728\u79bb\u7ebf\u8bc4\u4f30\u548c\u5728\u7ebfA/B\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u57fa\u7ebf\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u7528\u6237\u6ee1\u610f\u5ea6\u5728\u6b63\u8d1f\u53cd\u9988\u6bd4\u65b9\u9762\u76f8\u5bf9\u63d0\u534727%", "conclusion": "\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u591a\u9636\u6bb5\u8d8b\u52bf\u68c0\u6d4b\u6846\u67b6\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u5bf9\u8bdd\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u8d8b\u52bf\u67e5\u8be2\u68c0\u6d4b\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u7cfb\u7edf\u4f18\u5316\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u7528\u6237\u4f53\u9a8c"}}

To overcome this limitation, we propose a simplified yet effective framework that leverages prompt engineering with Chain-of-Thought task decomposition to guide reasoning within a single large language model. Specifically, our approach decomposes the relevance judgment process into four interpretable subtasks: translation, intent understanding, category matching, and relevance judgment -- and fine-tunes a base model (Qwen2.5-14B) using Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) for efficient adaptation. This design not only reduces computational and storage overhead but also enhances interpretability by explicitly structuring the model's reasoning path. Experimental results show that our single-model framework achieves competitive accuracy and high inference efficiency, processing 20 samples per second on a single A100 GPU. In the CIKM 2025 AnalytiCup Competition Proposals, our method achieved 0.8902 on the public leaderboard and 0.8889 on the private leaderboard, validating the effectiveness and robustness of the proposed approach.

We present the first large-scale, statistically powered audit of native probabilistic sampling in frontier LLMs, benchmarking 11 models across 15 distributions. To disentangle failure modes, we employ a dual-protocol design: Batch Generation, where a model produces N=1000 samples within one response, and Independent Requests, comprising $N=1000$ stateless calls. We observe a sharp protocol asymmetry: batch generation achieves only modest statistical validity, with a 13% median pass rate, while independent requests collapse almost entirely, with 10 of 11 models passing none of the distributions. Beyond this asymmetry, we reveal that sampling fidelity degrades monotonically with distributional complexity and aggravates as the requested sampling horizon N increases. Finally, we demonstrate the propagation of these failures into downstream tasks: models fail to enforce uniform answer-position constraints in MCQ generation and systematically violate demographic targets in attribute-constrained text-to-image prompt synthesis. These findings indicate that current LLMs lack a functional internal sampler, necessitating the use of external tools for applications requiring statistical guarantees.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u5bf9\u524d\u6cbf\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u539f\u751f\u6982\u7387\u91c7\u6837\u80fd\u529b\u7684\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u7edf\u8ba1\u5ba1\u8ba1\u663e\u793a\uff0c\u5f53\u524d\u6a21\u578b\u7f3a\u4e4f\u529f\u80fd\u6027\u5185\u90e8\u91c7\u6837\u5668\uff0c\u65e0\u6cd5\u6ee1\u8db3\u9700\u8981\u7edf\u8ba1\u4fdd\u8bc1\u7684\u5e94\u7528\u9700\u6c42\u3002", "motivation": "\u968f\u7740\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u4ece\u804a\u5929\u63a5\u53e3\u8f6c\u53d8\u4e3a\u6559\u80b2\u8bc4\u4f30\u548c\u5408\u6210\u6570\u636e\u6784\u5efa\u7b49\u9886\u57df\u7684\u968f\u673a\u7ba1\u9053\u6838\u5fc3\u7ec4\u4ef6\uff0c\u4ece\u6307\u5b9a\u6982\u7387\u5206\u5e03\u4e2d\u5fe0\u5b9e\u91c7\u6837\u7684\u80fd\u529b\u5df2\u6210\u4e3a\u529f\u80fd\u6027\u9700\u6c42\u800c\u975e\u7406\u8bba\u597d\u5947\u3002\u9700\u8981\u8bc4\u4f30\u5f53\u524dLLMs\u7684\u539f\u751f\u6982\u7387\u91c7\u6837\u80fd\u529b\u662f\u5426\u6ee1\u8db3\u5b9e\u9645\u5e94\u7528\u9700\u6c42\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u53cc\u534f\u8bae\u8bbe\u8ba1\u7684\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u7edf\u8ba1\u5ba1\u8ba1\uff1a1) \u6279\u91cf\u751f\u6210\u534f\u8bae\uff08\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u5355\u4e2a\u54cd\u5e94\u4e2d\u751f\u6210N=1000\u4e2a\u6837\u672c\uff09\uff1b2) \u72ec\u7acb\u8bf7\u6c42\u534f\u8bae\uff08\u8fdb\u884cN=1000\u6b21\u65e0\u72b6\u6001\u8c03\u7528\uff09\u3002\u5bf911\u4e2a\u524d\u6cbfLLM\u572815\u79cd\u5206\u5e03\u4e0a\u8fdb\u884c\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\uff0c\u5206\u6790\u91c7\u6837\u4fdd\u771f\u5ea6\u4e0e\u5206\u5e03\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u548c\u91c7\u6837\u8303\u56f4\u7684\u5173\u7cfb\u3002", "result": "\u53d1\u73b0\u663e\u8457\u7684\u534f\u8bae\u4e0d\u5bf9\u79f0\u6027\uff1a\u6279\u91cf\u751f\u6210\u4ec5\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e2d\u7b49\u7edf\u8ba1\u6709\u6548\u6027\uff08\u4e2d\u4f4d\u901a\u8fc7\u738713%\uff09\uff0c\u800c\u72ec\u7acb\u8bf7\u6c42\u51e0\u4e4e\u5b8c\u5168\u5d29\u6e83\uff0811\u4e2a\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\u670910\u4e2a\u5728\u6240\u6709\u5206\u5e03\u4e0a\u5747\u672a\u901a\u8fc7\uff09\u3002\u91c7\u6837\u4fdd\u771f\u5ea6\u968f\u5206\u5e03\u590d\u6742\u6027\u5355\u8c03\u4e0b\u964d\uff0c\u968f\u91c7\u6837\u8303\u56f4N\u589e\u52a0\u800c\u6076\u5316\u3002\u8fd9\u4e9b\u5931\u8d25\u4f1a\u4f20\u64ad\u5230\u4e0b\u6e38\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\uff0c\u5982\u591a\u9009\u9898\u751f\u6210\u4e2d\u7684\u5747\u5300\u7b54\u6848\u4f4d\u7f6e\u7ea6\u675f\u548c\u5c5e\u6027\u7ea6\u675f\u6587\u672c\u5230\u56fe\u50cf\u63d0\u793a\u5408\u6210\u4e2d\u7684\u4eba\u53e3\u7edf\u8ba1\u76ee\u6807\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5f53\u524d\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7f3a\u4e4f\u529f\u80fd\u6027\u5185\u90e8\u91c7\u6837\u5668\uff0c\u5bf9\u4e8e\u9700\u8981\u7edf\u8ba1\u4fdd\u8bc1\u7684\u5e94\u7528\uff0c\u5fc5\u987b\u4f7f\u7528\u5916\u90e8\u5de5\u5177\u3002\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u539f\u751f\u6982\u7387\u91c7\u6837\u80fd\u529b\u4e0d\u8db3\u4ee5\u652f\u6301\u6559\u80b2\u8bc4\u4f30\u548c\u5408\u6210\u6570\u636e\u6784\u5efa\u7b49\u9886\u57df\u7684\u5b9e\u9645\u5e94\u7528\u9700\u6c42\u3002"}}

However, current approaches, particularly remote sensing change detection, often rely on rigid, single-modal analysis. To overcome these limitations, we propose MMUEChange, a multi-modal agent framework that flexibly integrates heterogeneous urban data via a modular toolkit and a core module, Modality Controller for cross- and intra-modal alignment, enabling robust analysis of complex urban change scenarios. Case studies include: a shift toward small, community-focused parks in New York, reflecting local green space efforts; the spread of concentrated water pollution across districts in Hong Kong, pointing to coordinated water management; and a notable decline in open dumpsites in Shenzhen, with contrasting links between nighttime economic activity and waste types, indicating differing urban pressures behind domestic and construction waste.

However, this introduces challenges such as factual inconsistencies, source conflicts, bias propagation, and security vulnerabilities, which undermine the trustworthiness of RAG systems. A key gap in current RAG evaluation is the lack of a metric to quantify the contribution of individual retrieved documents to the final output. To address this, we introduce the Influence Score (IS), a novel metric based on Partial Information Decomposition that measures the impact of each retrieved document on the generated response. We validate IS through two experiments. First, a poison attack simulation across three datasets demonstrates that IS correctly identifies the malicious document as the most influential in $86\\%$ of cases. Second, an ablation study shows that a response generated using only the top-ranked documents by IS is consistently judged more similar to the original response than one generated from the remaining documents.

Using Moral Foundations Theory (MFT) as an analytic framework, we study how moral foundations are encoded, organized, and expressed within two instruction-tuned LLMs: Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct and Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct. We employ a multi-level approach combining (i) layer-wise analysis of MFT concept representations and their alignment with human moral perceptions, (ii) pretrained sparse autoencoders (SAEs) over the residual stream to identify sparse features that support moral concepts, and (iii) causal steering interventions using dense MFT vectors and sparse SAE features. We find that both models represent and distinguish moral foundations in a structured, layer-dependent way that aligns with human judgments. At a finer scale, SAE features show clear semantic links to specific foundations, suggesting partially disentangled mechanisms within shared representations. Finally, steering along either dense vectors or sparse features produces predictable shifts in foundation-relevant behavior, demonstrating a causal connection between internal representations and moral outputs. Together, our results provide mechanistic evidence that moral concepts in LLMs are distributed, layered, and partly disentangled, suggesting that pluralistic moral structure can emerge as a latent pattern from the statistical regularities of language alone.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u901a\u8fc7\u591a\u5c42\u6b21\u5206\u6790\u65b9\u6cd5\u53d1\u73b0\uff0c\u6307\u4ee4\u8c03\u4f18\u7684LLMs\u5185\u90e8\u5b58\u5728\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u3001\u5206\u5c42\u4e14\u90e8\u5206\u89e3\u8026\u7684\u9053\u5fb7\u6982\u5ff5\u8868\u793a\uff0c\u8fd9\u4e9b\u8868\u793a\u4e0e\u4eba\u7c7b\u9053\u5fb7\u5224\u65ad\u5bf9\u9f50\uff0c\u5e76\u80fd\u901a\u8fc7\u56e0\u679c\u5e72\u9884\u9884\u6d4b\u6027\u5730\u6539\u53d8\u9053\u5fb7\u8f93\u51fa\u884c\u4e3a\u3002", "motivation": "\u7814\u7a76\u52a8\u673a\u662f\u63a2\u7a76LLMs\u4ea7\u751f\u7684\u7c7b\u4f3c\u4eba\u7c7b\u7684\u9053\u5fb7\u5224\u65ad\u662f\u5426\u53cd\u6620\u4e86\u5185\u90e8\u6982\u5ff5\u7ed3\u6784\uff0c\u8fd8\u662f\u4ec5\u4ec5\u662f\u8868\u9762\u7684\"\u9053\u5fb7\u6a21\u4eff\"\u3002\u5c3d\u7ba1LLMs\u7ecf\u5e38\u4ea7\u751f\u7c7b\u4f3c\u4eba\u7c7b\u7684\u9053\u5fb7\u5224\u65ad\uff0c\u4f46\u5c1a\u4e0d\u6e05\u695a\u8fd9\u662f\u5426\u53cd\u6620\u4e86\u771f\u6b63\u7684\u9053\u5fb7\u7406\u89e3\u6216\u4ec5\u4ec5\u662f\u6a21\u5f0f\u5339\u914d\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u591a\u5c42\u6b21\u5206\u6790\u65b9\u6cd5\uff1a1) \u57fa\u4e8e\u9053\u5fb7\u57fa\u7840\u7406\u8bba(MFT)\u7684\u5c42\u95f4\u5206\u6790\uff0c\u7814\u7a76\u9053\u5fb7\u6982\u5ff5\u8868\u793a\u53ca\u5176\u4e0e\u4eba\u7c7b\u9053\u5fb7\u611f\u77e5\u7684\u5bf9\u9f50\uff1b2) \u5728\u6b8b\u5dee\u6d41\u4e0a\u4f7f\u7528\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684\u7a00\u758f\u81ea\u7f16\u7801\u5668(SAEs)\u8bc6\u522b\u652f\u6301\u9053\u5fb7\u6982\u5ff5\u7684\u7a00\u758f\u7279\u5f81\uff1b3) \u4f7f\u7528\u5bc6\u96c6MFT\u5411\u91cf\u548c\u7a00\u758fSAE\u7279\u5f81\u8fdb\u884c\u56e0\u679c\u5bfc\u5411\u5e72\u9884\u3002\u7814\u7a76\u5bf9\u8c61\u4e3aLlama-3.1-8B-Instruct\u548cQwen2.5-7B-Instruct\u4e24\u4e2a\u6307\u4ee4\u8c03\u4f18\u6a21\u578b\u3002", "result": "\u7814\u7a76\u53d1\u73b0\uff1a1) \u4e24\u4e2a\u6a21\u578b\u90fd\u4ee5\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u3001\u5206\u5c42\u4f9d\u8d56\u7684\u65b9\u5f0f\u8868\u793a\u548c\u533a\u5206\u9053\u5fb7\u57fa\u7840\uff0c\u4e14\u4e0e\u4eba\u7c7b\u5224\u65ad\u5bf9\u9f50\uff1b2) SAE\u7279\u5f81\u663e\u793a\u51fa\u4e0e\u7279\u5b9a\u9053\u5fb7\u57fa\u7840\u7684\u6e05\u6670\u8bed\u4e49\u8054\u7cfb\uff0c\u8868\u660e\u5728\u5171\u4eab\u8868\u793a\u4e2d\u5b58\u5728\u90e8\u5206\u89e3\u8026\u7684\u673a\u5236\uff1b3) \u6cbf\u7740\u5bc6\u96c6\u5411\u91cf\u6216\u7a00\u758f\u7279\u5f81\u8fdb\u884c\u5bfc\u5411\u5e72\u9884\u80fd\u4ea7\u751f\u53ef\u9884\u6d4b\u7684\u9053\u5fb7\u57fa\u7840\u76f8\u5173\u884c\u4e3a\u8f6c\u53d8\uff0c\u8bc1\u660e\u5185\u90e8\u8868\u793a\u4e0e\u9053\u5fb7\u8f93\u51fa\u4e4b\u95f4\u5b58\u5728\u56e0\u679c\u8054\u7cfb\u3002", "conclusion": "\u7814\u7a76\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u673a\u5236\u6027\u8bc1\u636e\uff0c\u8868\u660eLLMs\u4e2d\u7684\u9053\u5fb7\u6982\u5ff5\u662f\u5206\u5e03\u5f0f\u3001\u5206\u5c42\u4e14\u90e8\u5206\u89e3\u8026\u7684\uff0c\u8fd9\u8868\u660e\u591a\u5143\u9053\u5fb7\u7ed3\u6784\u53ef\u4ee5\u4ec5\u4ece\u8bed\u8a00\u7684\u7edf\u8ba1\u89c4\u5f8b\u4e2d\u4f5c\u4e3a\u6f5c\u5728\u6a21\u5f0f\u51fa\u73b0\uff0c\u800c\u4e0d\u4ec5\u4ec5\u662f\u8868\u9762\u6a21\u4eff\u3002"}}

This ambiguity is particularly consequential in medicine where uncertainty is pervasive. In this paper, we introduce a probabilistic paradigm to theoretically explain how high certainty in ground truth answers is almost always necessary for even an expert to achieve high scores, whereas in datasets with high variation in ground truth answers there may be little difference between a random labeller and an expert. Therefore, ignoring uncertainty in ground truth evaluation data can result in the misleading conclusion that a non-expert has similar performance to that of an expert. Using the probabilistic paradigm, we thus bring forth the concepts of expected accuracy and expected F1 to estimate the score an expert human or system can achieve given ground truth answer variability.\n  Our work leads to the recommendation that when establishing the capability of a system, results should be stratified by probability of the ground truth answer, typically measured by the agreement rate of ground truth experts. Stratification becomes critical when the overall performance drops below a threshold of 80%. Under stratified evaluation, performance comparison becomes more reliable in high certainty bins, mitigating the effect of the key confounding factor -- uncertainty.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u6982\u7387\u8bc4\u4f30\u8303\u5f0f\uff0c\u5f3a\u8c03\u533b\u5b66AI\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\u5ffd\u7565\u6807\u6ce8\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u7684\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5f15\u5165\u671f\u671b\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u548c\u671f\u671bF1\u5206\u6570\u6765\u4f30\u8ba1\u4e13\u5bb6\u5728\u6807\u6ce8\u53d8\u5f02\u4e0b\u7684\u8868\u73b0\uff0c\u5efa\u8bae\u6309\u6807\u6ce8\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u5206\u5c42\u8bc4\u4f30\u7cfb\u7edf\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "motivation": "\u5f53\u524dAI\u7cfb\u7edf\uff08\u7279\u522b\u662fLLM\u548c\u89c6\u89c9\u6a21\u578b\uff09\u7684\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u901a\u5e38\u5ffd\u7565\u4e13\u5bb6\u6807\u6ce8\u7b54\u6848\u4e2d\u7684\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\uff0c\u8fd9\u5728\u533b\u5b66\u9886\u57df\u5c24\u4e3a\u4e25\u91cd\uff0c\u56e0\u4e3a\u533b\u5b66\u6570\u636e\u5929\u7136\u5b58\u5728\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u3002\u5ffd\u7565\u8fd9\u79cd\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u53ef\u80fd\u5bfc\u81f4\u8bef\u5bfc\u6027\u7ed3\u8bba\uff0c\u5982\u975e\u4e13\u5bb6\u8868\u73b0\u4e0e\u4e13\u5bb6\u76f8\u4f3c\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u6982\u7387\u8bc4\u4f30\u8303\u5f0f\uff0c\u4ece\u7406\u8bba\u4e0a\u5206\u6790\u6807\u6ce8\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u5bf9\u8bc4\u4f30\u7ed3\u679c\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u3002\u5f15\u5165\u671f\u671b\u51c6\u786e\u7387(expected accuracy)\u548c\u671f\u671bF1\u5206\u6570(expected F1)\u6765\u4f30\u8ba1\u4e13\u5bb6\u5728\u6807\u6ce8\u53d8\u5f02\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u7684\u8868\u73b0\u3002\u5efa\u8bae\u6309\u6807\u6ce8\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\uff08\u901a\u5e38\u901a\u8fc7\u4e13\u5bb6\u95f4\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u7387\u8861\u91cf\uff09\u5bf9\u7ed3\u679c\u8fdb\u884c\u5206\u5c42\u8bc4\u4f30\u3002", "result": "\u7406\u8bba\u5206\u6790\u8868\u660e\uff1a\u9ad8\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u6807\u6ce8\u5bf9\u4e13\u5bb6\u83b7\u5f97\u9ad8\u5206\u51e0\u4e4e\u603b\u662f\u5fc5\u8981\u7684\uff1b\u5728\u6807\u6ce8\u53d8\u5f02\u5927\u7684\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e2d\uff0c\u968f\u673a\u6807\u6ce8\u8005\u4e0e\u4e13\u5bb6\u8868\u73b0\u5dee\u5f02\u5f88\u5c0f\u3002\u5206\u5c42\u8bc4\u4f30\u7b56\u7565\u4f7f\u9ad8\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u533a\u95f4\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u6bd4\u8f83\u66f4\u53ef\u9760\uff0c\u5f53\u603b\u4f53\u6027\u80fd\u4f4e\u4e8e80%\u65f6\u5206\u5c42\u5c24\u4e3a\u5173\u952e\u3002", "conclusion": "\u533b\u5b66AI\u8bc4\u4f30\u5fc5\u987b\u8003\u8651\u6807\u6ce8\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\uff0c\u91c7\u7528\u6982\u7387\u8bc4\u4f30\u8303\u5f0f\u548c\u5206\u5c42\u8bc4\u4f30\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002\u6309\u6807\u6ce8\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u5206\u5c42\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u63a7\u5236\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u8fd9\u4e00\u6df7\u6742\u56e0\u7d20\uff0c\u4f7f\u7cfb\u7edf\u80fd\u529b\u8bc4\u4f30\u66f4\u53ef\u9760\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5728\u603b\u4f53\u6027\u80fd\u8f83\u4f4e\u65f6\u3002"}}

However, the increasing volume of user-generated reviews has led to information overload, making it difficult for consumers to identify content that aligns with their specific preferences. Existing review ranking systems typically rely on metrics such as helpfulness votes, star ratings, and recency, but these fail to capture individual user interests and often treat textual sentiment and rating signals separately. This research addresses these limitations by proposing a personalized framework that integrates review ranking and abstractive summarization to enhance decision-making efficiency. The proposed system begins by modeling each user's sentiment through a hybrid analysis of star ratings and review content. Simultaneously, user preferences were derived from historical reviews using sentence embeddings and clustering, forming semantic profiles aligned with thematic and sentiment dimensions. A relevance scoring algorithm matched these profiles with unseen reviews based on sentiment and aspect similarity. Top-matched reviews were then summarized to reflect individual interests. A user study with 70 participants demonstrated that the personalized approach improved satisfaction, perceived relevance, and decision-making confidence, while reducing time spent reading. The results highlight the method's effectiveness in alleviating information overload and delivering content tailored to user-specific preferences, emphasizing its value in enhancing user experience in review-rich decision-making environments.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e2a\u6027\u5316\u8bc4\u8bba\u6392\u5e8f\u4e0e\u6458\u8981\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6574\u5408\u7528\u6237\u60c5\u611f\u5206\u6790\u548c\u504f\u597d\u5efa\u6a21\uff0c\u7f13\u89e3\u4fe1\u606f\u8fc7\u8f7d\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u51b3\u7b56\u6548\u7387\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u8bc4\u8bba\u6392\u5e8f\u7cfb\u7edf\u4f9d\u8d56\u6709\u7528\u6027\u6295\u7968\u3001\u661f\u7ea7\u8bc4\u5206\u548c\u65f6\u6548\u6027\u7b49\u901a\u7528\u6307\u6807\uff0c\u65e0\u6cd5\u6355\u6349\u4e2a\u4f53\u7528\u6237\u5174\u8da3\uff0c\u4e14\u901a\u5e38\u5c06\u6587\u672c\u60c5\u611f\u548c\u8bc4\u5206\u4fe1\u53f7\u5206\u5f00\u5904\u7406\u3002\u968f\u7740\u7528\u6237\u751f\u6210\u8bc4\u8bba\u6570\u91cf\u6fc0\u589e\u5bfc\u81f4\u4fe1\u606f\u8fc7\u8f7d\uff0c\u6d88\u8d39\u8005\u96be\u4ee5\u627e\u5230\u7b26\u5408\u4e2a\u4eba\u504f\u597d\u7684\u5185\u5bb9\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e2a\u6027\u5316\u6846\u67b6\u6574\u5408\u8bc4\u8bba\u6392\u5e8f\u548c\u62bd\u8c61\u6458\u8981\uff1a1\uff09\u901a\u8fc7\u661f\u7ea7\u8bc4\u5206\u548c\u8bc4\u8bba\u5185\u5bb9\u7684\u6df7\u5408\u5206\u6790\u5efa\u6a21\u7528\u6237\u60c5\u611f\uff1b2\uff09\u4f7f\u7528\u53e5\u5b50\u5d4c\u5165\u548c\u805a\u7c7b\u4ece\u5386\u53f2\u8bc4\u8bba\u4e2d\u63d0\u53d6\u7528\u6237\u504f\u597d\uff0c\u5f62\u6210\u4e0e\u4e3b\u9898\u548c\u60c5\u611f\u7ef4\u5ea6\u5bf9\u9f50\u7684\u8bed\u4e49\u6863\u6848\uff1b3\uff09\u57fa\u4e8e\u60c5\u611f\u548c\u65b9\u9762\u76f8\u4f3c\u6027\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u76f8\u5173\u6027\u8bc4\u5206\u7b97\u6cd5\u5339\u914d\u6863\u6848\u4e0e\u672a\u8bfb\u8bc4\u8bba\uff1b4\uff09\u5bf9\u5339\u914d\u5ea6\u6700\u9ad8\u7684\u8bc4\u8bba\u8fdb\u884c\u6458\u8981\u751f\u6210\u4ee5\u53cd\u6620\u4e2a\u4f53\u5174\u8da3\u3002", "result": "70\u540d\u53c2\u4e0e\u8005\u7684\u7528\u6237\u7814\u7a76\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u4e2a\u6027\u5316\u65b9\u6cd5\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u6ee1\u610f\u5ea6\u3001\u611f\u77e5\u76f8\u5173\u6027\u548c\u51b3\u7b56\u4fe1\u5fc3\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u51cf\u5c11\u4e86\u9605\u8bfb\u65f6\u95f4\u3002\u7ed3\u679c\u8bc1\u660e\u4e86\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u7f13\u89e3\u4fe1\u606f\u8fc7\u8f7d\u548c\u63d0\u4f9b\u7b26\u5408\u7528\u6237\u7279\u5b9a\u504f\u597d\u5185\u5bb9\u65b9\u9762\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u4e2a\u6027\u5316\u6846\u67b6\u901a\u8fc7\u6574\u5408\u60c5\u611f\u5206\u6790\u3001\u504f\u597d\u5efa\u6a21\u548c\u76f8\u5173\u6027\u5339\u914d\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u589e\u5f3a\u4e86\u8bc4\u8bba\u4e30\u5bcc\u51b3\u7b56\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u7684\u7528\u6237\u4f53\u9a8c\uff0c\u4e3a\u4e2a\u6027\u5316\u8bc4\u8bba\u5904\u7406\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u6709\u4ef7\u503c\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

A Study in Korean Self-Correction", "comment": "IJCNLP-AACL 2025 (Main), Outstanding Paper Award", "summary": "Large Language Models (LLMs) demonstrate strong reasoning and self-correction abilities in high-resource languages like English, but their performance remains limited in low-resource languages such as Korean. In this study, we investigate whether reinforcement learning (RL) can enhance Korean reasoning abilities to a degree comparable to English. Our findings reveal that RL alone yields limited improvements when applied to models lacking inherent Korean reasoning capabilities. To address this, we explore several fine-tuning strategies and show that aligning the model's internal reasoning processes with Korean inputs-particularly by tuning Korean-specific neurons in early layers-is key to unlocking RL's effectiveness. We introduce a self-correction code-switching dataset to facilitate this alignment and observe significant performance gains in both mathematical reasoning and self-correction tasks. Ultimately, we conclude that the crucial factor in multilingual reasoning enhancement is not injecting new linguistic knowledge, but effectively eliciting and aligning existing reasoning capabilities.

The authors identify a core failure mode, termed the \"competence paradox\" in which broadly capable LLMs are asked to emulate partially knowledgeable learners, leading to unrealistic error patterns and learning dynamics. To address this, the paper reframes student simulation as a constrained generation problem governed by an explicit Epistemic State Specification (ESS), which defines what a simulated learner can access, how errors are structured, and how learner state evolves over time. The work further introduces a Goal-by-Environment framework to situate simulated student systems according to behavioral objectives and deployment contexts. Rather than proposing a new system or benchmark, the paper synthesizes prior literature, formalizes key design dimensions, and articulates open challenges related to validity, evaluation, and ethical risks.

As Large Language Models (LLMs) become integral to robotics decision-making, the physical dimension of risk grows; a single wrong instruction can directly endanger human safety. This paper addresses the urgent need to systematically evaluate LLM performance in scenarios where even minor errors are catastrophic. Through a qualitative evaluation of a fire evacuation scenario, we identified critical failure cases in LLM-based decision-making. Based on these, we designed seven tasks for quantitative assessment, categorized into: Complete Information, Incomplete Information, and Safety-Oriented Spatial Reasoning (SOSR). Complete information tasks utilize ASCII maps to minimize interpretation ambiguity and isolate spatial reasoning from visual processing. Incomplete information tasks require models to infer missing context, testing for spatial continuity versus hallucinations. SOSR tasks use natural language to evaluate safe decision-making in life-threatening contexts. We benchmark various LLMs and Vision-Language Models (VLMs) across these tasks. Beyond aggregate performance, we analyze the implications of a 1% failure rate, highlighting how \"rare\" errors escalate into catastrophic outcomes. Results reveal serious vulnerabilities: several models achieved a 0% success rate in ASCII navigation, while in a simulated fire drill, models instructed robots to move toward hazardous areas instead of emergency exits. Our findings lead to a sobering conclusion: current LLMs are not ready for direct deployment in safety-critical systems. A 99% accuracy rate is dangerously misleading in robotics, as it implies one out of every hundred executions could result in catastrophic harm. We demonstrate that even state-of-the-art models cannot guarantee safety, and absolute reliance on them creates unacceptable risks.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u901a\u8fc7\u5b9a\u6027\u8bc4\u4f30\u706b\u707e\u758f\u6563\u573a\u666f\uff0c\u8bc6\u522bLLM\u51b3\u7b56\u4e2d\u7684\u5173\u952e\u5931\u8d25\u6848\u4f8b\uff0c\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4e03\u9879\u5b9a\u91cf\u8bc4\u4f30\u4efb\u52a1\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u5f53\u524dLLM\u5728\u5b89\u5168\u5173\u952e\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u5b58\u5728\u4e25\u91cd\u6f0f\u6d1e\uff0c99%\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u4ecd\u4f1a\u5bfc\u81f4\u707e\u96be\u6027\u540e\u679c\u3002", "motivation": "\u968f\u7740\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08LLM\uff09\u878d\u5165\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u51b3\u7b56\uff0c\u7269\u7406\u98ce\u9669\u7ef4\u5ea6\u589e\u52a0\uff0c\u5355\u4e2a\u9519\u8bef\u6307\u4ee4\u53ef\u80fd\u76f4\u63a5\u5371\u53ca\u4eba\u7c7b\u5b89\u5168\u3002\u8feb\u5207\u9700\u8981\u7cfb\u7edf\u8bc4\u4f30LLM\u5728\u5fae\u5c0f\u9519\u8bef\u5373\u53ef\u80fd\u9020\u6210\u707e\u96be\u6027\u540e\u679c\u7684\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u706b\u707e\u758f\u6563\u573a\u666f\u7684\u5b9a\u6027\u8bc4\u4f30\u8bc6\u522b\u5173\u952e\u5931\u8d25\u6848\u4f8b\uff0c\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4e03\u9879\u5b9a\u91cf\u8bc4\u4f30\u4efb\u52a1\uff1a\u5b8c\u6574\u4fe1\u606f\u4efb\u52a1\uff08\u4f7f\u7528ASCII\u5730\u56fe\u51cf\u5c11\u89e3\u91ca\u6b67\u4e49\uff09\u3001\u4e0d\u5b8c\u6574\u4fe1\u606f\u4efb\u52a1\uff08\u6d4b\u8bd5\u7a7a\u95f4\u8fde\u7eed\u6027\u4e0e\u5e7b\u89c9\uff09\u3001\u5b89\u5168\u5bfc\u5411\u7a7a\u95f4\u63a8\u7406\u4efb\u52a1\uff08\u8bc4\u4f30\u751f\u547d\u5a01\u80c1\u60c5\u5883\u4e0b\u7684\u5b89\u5168\u51b3\u7b56\uff09\u3002\u5bf9\u591a\u79cdLLM\u548c\u89c6\u89c9\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u8fdb\u884c\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u3002", "result": "\u7ed3\u679c\u63ed\u793a\u4e25\u91cd\u6f0f\u6d1e\uff1a\u591a\u4e2a\u6a21\u578b\u5728ASCII\u5bfc\u822a\u4e2d\u6210\u529f\u7387\u4e3a0%\uff1b\u5728\u6a21\u62df\u6d88\u9632\u6f14\u4e60\u4e2d\uff0c\u6a21\u578b\u6307\u793a\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u5411\u5371\u9669\u533a\u57df\u800c\u975e\u7d27\u6025\u51fa\u53e3\u79fb\u52a8\u3002\u5206\u6790\u663e\u793a1%\u5931\u8d25\u7387\u5982\u4f55\u5347\u7ea7\u4e3a\u707e\u96be\u6027\u540e\u679c\uff0c\u5f53\u524dLLM\u65e0\u6cd5\u4fdd\u8bc1\u5b89\u5168\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5f53\u524dLLM\u4e0d\u9002\u5408\u76f4\u63a5\u90e8\u7f72\u4e8e\u5b89\u5168\u5173\u952e\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c99%\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u5728\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u9886\u57df\u5177\u6709\u8bef\u5bfc\u6027\u4e14\u5371\u9669\uff0c\u610f\u5473\u7740\u6bcf\u767e\u6b21\u6267\u884c\u53ef\u80fd\u9020\u6210\u707e\u96be\u6027\u4f24\u5bb3\u3002\u5373\u4f7f\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u6a21\u578b\u4e5f\u65e0\u6cd5\u4fdd\u8bc1\u5b89\u5168\uff0c\u7edd\u5bf9\u4f9d\u8d56\u5b83\u4eec\u4f1a\u4ea7\u751f\u4e0d\u53ef\u63a5\u53d7\u7684\u98ce\u9669\u3002"}}

While current models resist explicit misinformation, we uncover a fundamental vulnerability to sophisticated, hard-to-falsify evidence. To systematically probe this weakness, we introduce MisBelief, a framework that generates misleading evidence via collaborative, multi-round interactions among multi-role LLMs. This process mimics subtle, defeasible reasoning and progressive refinement to create logically persuasive yet factually deceptive claims. Using MisBelief, we generate 4,800 instances across three difficulty levels to evaluate 7 representative LLMs. Results indicate that while models are robust to direct misinformation, they are highly sensitive to this refined evidence: belief scores in falsehoods increase by an average of 93.0\\%, fundamentally compromising downstream recommendations. To address this, we propose Deceptive Intent Shielding (DIS), a governance mechanism that provides an early warning signal by inferring the deceptive intent behind evidence. Empirical results demonstrate that DIS consistently mitigates belief shifts and promotes more cautious evidence evaluation.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51faMisBelief\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u591a\u8f6e\u591a\u89d2\u8272LLM\u534f\u4f5c\u751f\u6210\u96be\u4ee5\u8bc1\u4f2a\u7684\u8bef\u5bfc\u6027\u8bc1\u636e\uff0c\u63ed\u793aLLMs\u5bf9\u590d\u6742\u8bc1\u636e\u7684\u6839\u672c\u6027\u8106\u5f31\u6027\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u51faDeceptive Intent Shielding\u6cbb\u7406\u673a\u5236\u8fdb\u884c\u9632\u5fa1\u3002", "motivation": "\u5f53\u524dLLMs\u80fd\u591f\u62b5\u6297\u663e\u5f0f\u9519\u8bef\u4fe1\u606f\uff0c\u4f46\u5bf9\u590d\u6742\u3001\u96be\u4ee5\u8bc1\u4f2a\u7684\u8bef\u5bfc\u6027\u8bc1\u636e\u5b58\u5728\u6839\u672c\u6027\u8106\u5f31\u6027\u3002\u4e3a\u786e\u4fddLLMs\u53ef\u9760\u8f85\u52a9\u4eba\u7c7b\u51b3\u7b56\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u7cfb\u7edf\u63a2\u7a76\u8fd9\u79cd\u5f31\u70b9\u5e76\u5f00\u53d1\u9632\u5fa1\u673a\u5236\u3002", "method": "1. \u63d0\u51faMisBelief\u6846\u67b6\uff1a\u901a\u8fc7\u591a\u89d2\u8272LLM\u534f\u4f5c\uff0c\u6a21\u62df\u5fae\u5999\u3001\u53ef\u53cd\u9a73\u7684\u63a8\u7406\u8fc7\u7a0b\uff0c\u751f\u6210\u903b\u8f91\u4e0a\u5177\u6709\u8bf4\u670d\u529b\u4f46\u4e8b\u5b9e\u9519\u8bef\u7684\u8bef\u5bfc\u6027\u8bc1\u636e\u30022. \u751f\u6210\u4e09\u4e2a\u96be\u5ea6\u7ea7\u522b\u76844,800\u4e2a\u6d4b\u8bd5\u5b9e\u4f8b\u30023. \u8bc4\u4f307\u4e2a\u4ee3\u8868\u6027LLMs\u30024. \u63d0\u51faDeceptive Intent Shielding\u6cbb\u7406\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u63a8\u65ad\u8bc1\u636e\u80cc\u540e\u7684\u6b3a\u9a97\u610f\u56fe\u63d0\u4f9b\u65e9\u671f\u9884\u8b66\u3002", "result": "1.

In contrast, progress in LLM reasoning models remains limited in scientific domains such as medicine and materials science due to limited dataset coverage and the inherent complexity of open-ended scientific questions. To address these challenges, we introduce WildSci, a new dataset of domain-specific science questions automatically synthesized from peer-reviewed literature, covering 9 scientific disciplines and 26 subdomains. By framing complex scientific reasoning tasks in a multiple-choice format, we enable scalable training with well-defined reward signals. We further apply reinforcement learning to finetune models on these data and analyze the resulting training dynamics, including domain-specific performance changes, response behaviors, and generalization trends. Experiments on a suite of scientific benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of our dataset and approach.

While memory-augmented frameworks offer a structured alternative, current systems rely on static prompting of closed-source models or suffer from ineffective training paradigms with sparse rewards. We introduce MemBuilder, a reinforcement learning framework that trains models to orchestrate multi-dimensional memory construction with attributed dense rewards. MemBuilder addresses two key challenges: (1) Sparse Trajectory-Level Rewards: we employ synthetic session-level question generation to provide dense intermediate rewards across extended trajectories; and (2) Multi-Dimensional Memory Attribution: we introduce contribution-aware gradient weighting that scales policy updates based on each component's downstream impact. Experimental results show that MemBuilder enables a 4B-parameter model to outperform state-of-the-art closed-source baselines, exhibiting strong generalization across long-term dialogue benchmarks.", "AI": {"tldr": "MemBuilder\uff1a\u4e00\u4e2a\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5bc6\u96c6\u5956\u52b1\u548c\u591a\u7ef4\u8bb0\u5fc6\u5f52\u56e0\u8bad\u7ec3\u6a21\u578b\u6784\u5efa\u957f\u671f\u5bf9\u8bdd\u8bb0\u5fc6\uff0c\u4f7f4B\u53c2\u6570\u6a21\u578b\u8d85\u8d8a\u95ed\u6e90\u57fa\u7ebf\u3002", "motivation": "\u957f\u671f\u5bf9\u8bdd\u4e2d\u4fdd\u6301\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u662fLLMs\u7684\u57fa\u672c\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u6807\u51c6\u68c0\u7d22\u673a\u5236\u96be\u4ee5\u6355\u6349\u5386\u53f2\u72b6\u6001\u7684\u65f6\u5e8f\u6f14\u53d8\u3002\u73b0\u6709\u8bb0\u5fc6\u589e\u5f3a\u6846\u67b6\u8981\u4e48\u4f9d\u8d56\u95ed\u6e90\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u9759\u6001\u63d0\u793a\uff0c\u8981\u4e48\u8bad\u7ec3\u8303\u5f0f\u65e0\u6548\u4e14\u5956\u52b1\u7a00\u758f\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faMemBuilder\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u6846\u67b6\uff1a1) \u4f7f\u7528\u5408\u6210\u4f1a\u8bdd\u7ea7\u95ee\u9898\u751f\u6210\u63d0\u4f9b\u5bc6\u96c6\u4e2d\u95f4\u5956\u52b1\uff1b2) \u5f15\u5165\u8d21\u732e\u611f\u77e5\u68af\u5ea6\u52a0\u6743\uff0c\u6839\u636e\u5404\u7ec4\u4ef6\u4e0b\u6e38\u5f71\u54cd\u7f29\u653e\u7b56\u7565\u66f4\u65b0\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u591a\u7ef4\u8bb0\u5fc6\u6784\u5efa\u7684\u534f\u8c03\u3002", "result": "MemBuilder\u4f7f4B\u53c2\u6570\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u957f\u671f\u5bf9\u8bdd\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\u8d85\u8d8a\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u7684\u95ed\u6e90\u57fa\u7ebf\uff0c\u5c55\u73b0\u51fa\u5f3a\u5927\u7684\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "conclusion": "MemBuilder\u901a\u8fc7\u5bc6\u96c6\u5956\u52b1\u548c\u8d21\u732e\u611f\u77e5\u8bad\u7ec3\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u957f\u671f\u5bf9\u8bdd\u8bb0\u5fc6\u6784\u5efa\u7684\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u4e3a\u5f00\u6e90\u6a21\u578b\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u8d85\u8d8a\u95ed\u6e90\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

While latent memory offers a solution, current approaches are hindered by architectural segregation, relying on auxiliary encoders that decouple memory from the reasoning backbone. We propose FlashMem, a framework that distills intrinsic memory directly from transient reasoning states via computation reuse. Leveraging the property that internal representations uniquely encode input trajectories, FlashMem identifies the last hidden state as a sufficient statistic for the interaction history. This enables a Shared-KV Consolidator to synthesize memory by attending directly to the backbone's frozen cache, eliminating redundant re-parameterization. Furthermore, a parameter-free Cognitive Monitor leverages attention entropy to adaptively trigger consolidation only when high epistemic uncertainty is detected. Experiments demonstrate that FlashMem matches the performance of heavy baselines while reducing inference latency by 5 times, effectively bridging the gap between efficiency and persistent cognition.", "AI": {"tldr": "FlashMem\u901a\u8fc7\u91cd\u7528\u63a8\u7406\u8ba1\u7b97\u4ece\u77ac\u65f6\u72b6\u6001\u84b8\u998f\u5185\u5728\u8bb0\u5fc6\uff0c\u65e0\u9700\u989d\u5916\u7f16\u7801\u5668\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u9ad8\u6548\u957f\u65f6\u81ea\u4e3b\u6027", "motivation": "\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u65e0\u72b6\u6001\u67b6\u6784\u7f3a\u4e4f\u52a8\u6001\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u4fdd\u6301\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u9700\u8981\u5197\u4f59\u91cd\u5904\u7406\u5386\u53f2\u4fe1\u606f\u6765\u7ef4\u6301\u957f\u65f6\u81ea\u4e3b\u6027\u3002\u73b0\u6709\u6f5c\u5728\u8bb0\u5fc6\u65b9\u6cd5\u5b58\u5728\u67b6\u6784\u5206\u79bb\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u4f9d\u8d56\u4e0e\u63a8\u7406\u4e3b\u5e72\u89e3\u8026\u7684\u8f85\u52a9\u7f16\u7801\u5668\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faFlashMem\u6846\u67b6\uff1a1\uff09\u5229\u7528\u5185\u90e8\u8868\u793a\u552f\u4e00\u7f16\u7801\u8f93\u5165\u8f68\u8ff9\u7684\u7279\u6027\uff0c\u5c06\u6700\u540e\u9690\u85cf\u72b6\u6001\u4f5c\u4e3a\u4ea4\u4e92\u5386\u53f2\u7684\u5145\u5206\u7edf\u8ba1\u91cf\uff1b2\uff09\u8bbe\u8ba1\u5171\u4eabKV\u6574\u5408\u5668\uff0c\u76f4\u63a5\u5173\u6ce8\u4e3b\u5e72\u51bb\u7ed3\u7f13\u5b58\u6765\u5408\u6210\u8bb0\u5fc6\uff0c\u6d88\u9664\u5197\u4f59\u53c2\u6570\u5316\uff1b3\uff09\u5f15\u5165\u65e0\u53c2\u6570\u8ba4\u77e5\u76d1\u63a7\u5668\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u71b5\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u89e6\u53d1\u6574\u5408\uff0c\u4ec5\u5728\u9ad8\u8ba4\u77e5\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u65f6\u6267\u884c\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660eFlashMem\u5728\u4fdd\u6301\u91cd\u578b\u57fa\u7ebf\u6027\u80fd\u7684\u540c\u65f6\uff0c\u5c06\u63a8\u7406\u5ef6\u8fdf\u964d\u4f4e5\u500d\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u5f25\u5408\u6548\u7387\u4e0e\u6301\u4e45\u8ba4\u77e5\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u5dee\u8ddd\u3002", "conclusion": "FlashMem\u901a\u8fc7\u8ba1\u7b97\u91cd\u7528\u76f4\u63a5\u4ece\u63a8\u7406\u72b6\u6001\u84b8\u998f\u5185\u5728\u8bb0\u5fc6\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u73b0\u6709\u8bb0\u5fc6\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u67b6\u6784\u5206\u79bb\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u957f\u65f6\u81ea\u4e3b\u6027\uff0c\u4e3a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u7cfb\u7edf\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u5b9e\u7528\u7684\u8bb0\u5fc6\u673a\u5236\u3002"}}

However, despite their theoretical promise, the application of Large Language Models (LLMs) to fraud detection in real-world financial contexts remains largely unexploited, and their practical effectiveness in handling domain-specific e-commerce transaction data has yet to be empirically validated. To bridge this gap between conventional machine learning limitations and the untapped potential of LLMs in fraud detection, this paper proposes a novel approach that employs Reinforcement Learning (RL) to post-train lightweight language models specifically for fraud detection tasks using only raw transaction data. We utilize the Group Sequence Policy Optimization (GSPO) algorithm combined with a rule-based reward system to fine-tune language models of various sizes on a real-life transaction dataset provided by a Chinese global payment solution company. Through this reinforcement learning framework, the language models are encouraged to explore diverse trust and risk signals embedded within the textual transaction data, including patterns in customer information, shipping details, product descriptions, and order history. Our experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of this approach, with post-trained language models achieving substantial F1-score improvements on held-out test data. Our findings demonstrate that the observed performance improvements are primarily attributable to the exploration mechanism inherent in reinforcement learning, which allows models to discover novel fraud indicators beyond those captured by traditional engineered features.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u4f7f\u7528\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u5bf9\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u8fdb\u884c\u540e\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u4e13\u95e8\u7528\u4e8e\u7535\u5b50\u5546\u52a1\u6b3a\u8bc8\u68c0\u6d4b\u4efb\u52a1\uff0c\u4ec5\u4f7f\u7528\u539f\u59cb\u4ea4\u6613\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u5728\u771f\u5b9e\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u53d6\u5f97\u4e86\u663e\u8457\u6027\u80fd\u63d0\u5347\u3002", "motivation": "\u5c3d\u7ba1\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u7406\u8bba\u4e0a\u5177\u6709\u6f5c\u529b\uff0c\u4f46\u5728\u5b9e\u9645\u91d1\u878d\u6b3a\u8bc8\u68c0\u6d4b\u4e2d\u7684\u5e94\u7528\u5c1a\u672a\u5145\u5206\u63a2\u7d22\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5728\u5904\u7406\u7279\u5b9a\u9886\u57df\u7684\u7535\u5b50\u5546\u52a1\u4ea4\u6613\u6570\u636e\u65b9\u9762\u7f3a\u4e4f\u5b9e\u8bc1\u9a8c\u8bc1\u3002\u9700\u8981\u5f25\u5408\u4f20\u7edf\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u5c40\u9650\u6027\u4e0eLLMs\u5728\u6b3a\u8bc8\u68c0\u6d4b\u4e2d\u672a\u5f00\u53d1\u6f5c\u529b\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u5dee\u8ddd\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528Group Sequence Policy Optimization (GSPO)\u7b97\u6cd5\u7ed3\u5408\u57fa\u4e8e\u89c4\u5219\u7684\u5956\u52b1\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u5bf9\u591a\u79cd\u89c4\u6a21\u7684\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u8fdb\u884c\u540e\u8bad\u7ec3\uff0c\u4e13\u95e8\u9488\u5bf9\u6b3a\u8bc8\u68c0\u6d4b\u4efb\u52a1\u3002\u6a21\u578b\u4ece\u539f\u59cb\u4ea4\u6613\u6570\u636e\u7684\u6587\u672c\u4fe1\u606f\u4e2d\u63a2\u7d22\u591a\u6837\u5316\u7684\u4fe1\u4efb\u548c\u98ce\u9669\u4fe1\u53f7\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u6709\u6548\uff0c\u540e\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u4fdd\u7559\u6d4b\u8bd5\u6570\u636e\u4e0a\u53d6\u5f97\u4e86\u663e\u8457\u7684F1\u5206\u6570\u63d0\u5347\u3002\u6027\u80fd\u6539\u8fdb\u4e3b\u8981\u5f52\u56e0\u4e8e\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u56fa\u6709\u7684\u63a2\u7d22\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u4f7f\u6a21\u578b\u80fd\u591f\u53d1\u73b0\u8d85\u8d8a\u4f20\u7edf\u5de5\u7a0b\u7279\u5f81\u7684\u65b0\u578b\u6b3a\u8bc8\u6307\u6807\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u6846\u67b6\u4e3a\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u6b3a\u8bc8\u68c0\u6d4b\u9886\u57df\u7684\u5e94\u7528\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u6709\u6548\u9014\u5f84\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u4ece\u539f\u59cb\u4ea4\u6613\u6570\u636e\u4e2d\u81ea\u52a8\u53d1\u73b0\u590d\u6742\u7684\u6b3a\u8bc8\u6a21\u5f0f\uff0c\u8d85\u8d8a\u4e86\u4f20\u7edf\u7279\u5f81\u5de5\u7a0b\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u5c40\u9650\u6027\u3002"}}

This paper introduces a retrieval-augmented multi-LLM ensemble framework that orchestrates nine state-of-the-art Large Language Models (LLMs) within a structured three-phase pipeline. RAGsemble addresses key limitations of single-model systems by combining the complementary strengths of model families including Gemini (2.0, 2.5, 1.5), OpenAI (GPT-4o, o4-mini), Mistral Large, and Gemma (1B, 4B, 3n-e4b), while grounding outputs in factual data using FAISS-based semantic retrieval. The system architecture consists of three stages: (1) parallel extraction by diverse LLMs, (2) targeted research augmentation leveraging high-performing models, and (3) intelligent synthesis with conflict resolution and confidence-aware scoring. RAG integration provides real-time access to structured part databases, enabling the system to validate, refine, and enrich outputs through similarity-based reference retrieval. Experimental results using real industrial datasets demonstrate significant gains in extraction accuracy, technical completeness, and structured output quality compared to leading single-LLM baselines.

Using the \\textit{Twenty-Four Histories}, we construct a large-scale, domain-aware event taxonomy covering politics, military, diplomacy, and social life in ancient China.

However, click data is heavily biased, i.e., users tend to click higher-ranked items (position bias), choose only what was shown to them (selection bias), and trust top results more (trust bias). Without explicitly modeling these biases, the true relevance of ranked items cannot be correctly learned from clicks. Existing Unbiased Learning-to-Rank (ULTR) methods mainly correct position bias and rely on propensity estimation, but they cannot measure remaining bias, provide risk guarantees, or jointly handle multiple bias sources. To overcome these challenges, this paper introduces a novel causal learning-based ranking framework that extends ULTR by combining Structural Causal Models (SCMs) with information-theoretic tools. SCMs specify how clicks are generated and help identify the true relevance signal from click data, while conditional mutual information, measures how much bias leaks into the\n  learned relevance estimates. We use this leakage measure to define a rigorous notion of disentanglement and include it as a regularizer during model training to reduce bias. In addition, we incorporate a causal inference estimator, i.e., doubly robust estimator, to ensure more reliable risk estimation.

Inductive KGC methods can handle the emerging entities and relations in KGs, offering greater dynamic adaptability. While existing inductive KGC methods have achieved some success, they also face challenges, such as susceptibility to noisy structural information during reasoning and difficulty in capturing long-range dependencies in reasoning paths. To address these challenges, this paper proposes the Cumulative Path-Level Semantic Reasoning for inductive knowledge graph completion (CPSR) framework, which simultaneously captures both the structural and semantic information of KGs to enhance the inductive KGC task. Specifically, the proposed CPSR employs a query-dependent masking module to adaptively mask noisy structural information while retaining important information closely related to the targets.

Yet, while controlled generation methods from prompting to fine-tuning proliferate, a fundamental question remains unanswered: are these models truly controllable in the first place? In this work, we provide a theoretical framework to formally answer this question. Framing human-model interaction as a control process, we propose a novel algorithm to estimate the controllable sets of models in a dialogue setting. Notably, we provide formal guarantees on the estimation error as a function of sample complexity: we derive probably-approximately correct bounds for controllable set estimates that are distribution-free, employ no assumptions except for output boundedness, and work for any black-box nonlinear control system (i.e., any generative model). We empirically demonstrate the theoretical framework on different tasks in controlling dialogue processes, for both language models and text-to-image generation. Our results show that model controllability is surprisingly fragile and highly dependent on the experimental setting. This highlights the need for rigorous controllability analysis, shifting the focus from simply attempting control to first understanding its fundamental limits.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u7406\u8bba\u6846\u67b6\u6765\u5f62\u5f0f\u5316\u5206\u6790\u751f\u6210\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u53ef\u63a7\u6027\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5bf9\u8bdd\u573a\u666f\u4e0b\u7684\u53ef\u63a7\u96c6\u4f30\u8ba1\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u8bc1\u660e\u4e86\u5206\u5e03\u65e0\u5173\u7684PAC\u8fb9\u754c\uff0c\u5e76\u5b9e\u8bc1\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u6a21\u578b\u53ef\u63a7\u6027\u7684\u8106\u5f31\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u968f\u7740\u751f\u6210\u6a21\u578b\u53d8\u5f97\u65e0\u5904\u4e0d\u5728\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u7ec6\u7c92\u5ea6\u63a7\u5236\u751f\u6210\u8fc7\u7a0b\u3002\u7136\u800c\uff0c\u5c3d\u7ba1\u4ece\u63d0\u793a\u5230\u5fae\u8c03\u7684\u5404\u79cd\u63a7\u5236\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e0d\u65ad\u6d8c\u73b0\uff0c\u4e00\u4e2a\u57fa\u672c\u95ee\u9898\u4ecd\u672a\u89e3\u51b3\uff1a\u8fd9\u4e9b\u6a21\u578b\u662f\u5426\u771f\u6b63\u53ef\u63a7\uff1f\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u65e8\u5728\u901a\u8fc7\u7406\u8bba\u6846\u67b6\u6b63\u5f0f\u56de\u7b54\u8fd9\u4e2a\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u5c06\u4eba\u673a\u4ea4\u4e92\u5efa\u6a21\u4e3a\u63a7\u5236\u8fc7\u7a0b\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u9896\u7b97\u6cd5\u6765\u4f30\u8ba1\u5bf9\u8bdd\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u53ef\u63a7\u96c6\u3002\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u63d0\u4f9b\u5f62\u5f0f\u5316\u4fdd\u8bc1\uff1a\u63a8\u5bfc\u51fa\u53ef\u63a7\u96c6\u4f30\u8ba1\u7684\u5206\u5e03\u65e0\u5173\u3001\u6982\u7387\u8fd1\u4f3c\u6b63\u786e(PAC)\u8fb9\u754c\uff0c\u4ec5\u9700\u8f93\u51fa\u6709\u754c\u6027\u5047\u8bbe\uff0c\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u4efb\u4f55\u9ed1\u76d2\u975e\u7ebf\u6027\u63a7\u5236\u7cfb\u7edf\uff08\u5373\u4efb\u4f55\u751f\u6210\u6a21\u578b\uff09\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u548c\u6587\u672c\u5230\u56fe\u50cf\u751f\u6210\u7684\u4e0d\u540c\u5bf9\u8bdd\u63a7\u5236\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u8fdb\u884c\u4e86\u5b9e\u8bc1\u9a8c\u8bc1\u3002\u7ed3\u679c\u663e\u793a\u6a21\u578b\u53ef\u63a7\u6027\u51fa\u4eba\u610f\u6599\u5730\u8106\u5f31\uff0c\u4e14\u9ad8\u5ea6\u4f9d\u8d56\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8bbe\u7f6e\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5f3a\u8c03\u9700\u8981\u8fdb\u884c\u4e25\u683c\u7684\u53ef\u63a7\u6027\u5206\u6790\uff0c\u5c06\u91cd\u70b9\u4ece\u7b80\u5355\u5c1d\u8bd5\u63a7\u5236\u8f6c\u5411\u9996\u5148\u7406\u89e3\u5176\u57fa\u672c\u9650\u5236\u3002\u6a21\u578b\u53ef\u63a7\u6027\u5e76\u975e\u7406\u6240\u5f53\u7136\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u7cfb\u7edf\u6027\u7684\u7406\u8bba\u6846\u67b6\u6765\u8bc4\u4f30\u548c\u4fdd\u8bc1\u3002"}}

While digital archives now offer unprecedented access to these materials, the ability to systematically study illustrations at a large scale remains challenging. Our study presents a fast and scalable AI approach for detecting, extracting, and describing illustrations in digitized manuscripts. Focusing on collections like the Vatican Library, our system enables efficient visual analysis across millions of pages. Our pipeline consists of three stages: (1) a fine-tuned image classification model filters out text-only pages; (2) an efficient object detection model identifies and crops illustrations; and (3) a multimodal image captioning model generates concise, human-readable descriptions. These are stored in a searchable database, allowing scholars to retrieve relevant visual materials through keyword queries. By harnessing the power of recent AI advancements, we enable large-scale visual research that was previously impractical, empowering scholars in historical studies, art history, and cultural heritage to explore visual motifs, artistic styles, and cross-cultural influences with new precision and speed. Applying our pipeline to over three million digitized manuscript pages, we automatically identified and extracted more than 200,000 unique illustrations. This scale of processing in under 0.06 seconds per page, dramatically outperforms traditional segmentation techniques in both efficiency and accessibility for visual scholarship. Our work demonstrates how cutting-edge AI tools can profoundly reshape scholarly workflows and open new avenues for multidisciplinary research in the age of digital manuscripts.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u4e2a\u5feb\u901f\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u7684AI\u6d41\u6c34\u7ebf\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u68c0\u6d4b\u3001\u63d0\u53d6\u548c\u63cf\u8ff0\u6570\u5b57\u5316\u624b\u7a3f\u4e2d\u7684\u63d2\u56fe\uff0c\u5e94\u7528\u4e8e\u68b5\u8482\u5188\u56fe\u4e66\u9986\u7b49\u6536\u85cf\uff0c\u5904\u7406\u8d85\u8fc7300\u4e07\u9875\u5e76\u63d0\u53d620\u591a\u4e07\u5f20\u63d2\u56fe\u3002", "motivation": "AI\u9769\u547d\u4e3a\u4eba\u6587\u5b66\u79d1\u5e26\u6765\u4e86\u53d8\u9769\u53ef\u80fd\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u89e3\u9501\u5386\u53f2\u624b\u7a3f\u4e2d\u7684\u89c6\u89c9\u5185\u5bb9\u3002\u867d\u7136\u6570\u5b57\u6863\u6848\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u524d\u6240\u672a\u6709\u7684\u8bbf\u95ee\u9014\u5f84\uff0c\u4f46\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u7cfb\u7edf\u7814\u7a76\u63d2\u56fe\u4ecd\u7136\u5177\u6709\u6311\u6218\u6027\u3002\u9700\u8981\u4e00\u79cd\u9ad8\u6548\u65b9\u6cd5\u6765\u652f\u6301\u5386\u53f2\u7814\u7a76\u3001\u827a\u672f\u53f2\u548c\u6587\u5316\u9057\u4ea7\u9886\u57df\u7684\u89c6\u89c9\u5206\u6790\u3002", "method": "\u4e09\u9636\u6bb5\u6d41\u6c34\u7ebf\uff1a1) \u5fae\u8c03\u56fe\u50cf\u5206\u7c7b\u6a21\u578b\u8fc7\u6ee4\u7eaf\u6587\u672c\u9875\u9762\uff1b2) \u9ad8\u6548\u76ee\u6807\u68c0\u6d4b\u6a21\u578b\u8bc6\u522b\u5e76\u88c1\u526a\u63d2\u56fe\uff1b3) \u591a\u6a21\u6001\u56fe\u50cf\u63cf\u8ff0\u6a21\u578b\u751f\u6210\u7b80\u6d01\u3001\u4eba\u7c7b\u53ef\u8bfb\u7684\u63cf\u8ff0\u3002\u7ed3\u679c\u5b58\u50a8\u5728\u53ef\u641c\u7d22\u6570\u636e\u5e93\u4e2d\uff0c\u652f\u6301\u5173\u952e\u8bcd\u67e5\u8be2\u68c0\u7d22\u3002", "result": "\u5e94\u7528\u4e8e\u8d85\u8fc7300\u4e07\u9875\u6570\u5b57\u5316\u624b\u7a3f\uff0c\u81ea\u52a8\u8bc6\u522b\u5e76\u63d0\u53d6\u4e86\u8d85\u8fc720\u4e07\u5f20\u72ec\u7279\u63d2\u56fe\u3002\u5904\u7406\u901f\u5ea6\u8fbe\u5230\u6bcf\u9875\u4f4e\u4e8e0.06\u79d2\uff0c\u5728\u6548\u7387\u548c\u53ef\u8bbf\u95ee\u6027\u65b9\u9762\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u4f20\u7edf\u5206\u5272\u6280\u672f\u3002", "conclusion": "\u524d\u6cbfAI\u5de5\u5177\u80fd\u591f\u6df1\u523b\u91cd\u5851\u5b66\u672f\u5de5\u4f5c\u6d41\u7a0b\uff0c\u4e3a\u6570\u5b57\u624b\u7a3f\u65f6\u4ee3\u7684\u591a\u5b66\u79d1\u7814\u7a76\u5f00\u8f9f\u65b0\u9014\u5f84\u3002\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u4f7f\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u89c6\u89c9\u7814\u7a76\u53d8\u5f97\u53ef\u884c\uff0c\u8d4b\u80fd\u5b66\u8005\u4ee5\u65b0\u7684\u7cbe\u5ea6\u548c\u901f\u5ea6\u63a2\u7d22\u89c6\u89c9\u4e3b\u9898\u3001\u827a\u672f\u98ce\u683c\u548c\u8de8\u6587\u5316\u5f71\u54cd\u3002"}}

A robust framework should be Topic-Adaptive, capturing macro-level joint distributions while ensuring micro-level individual rationality. Existing approaches fall into two categories: static data-based retrieval methods that fail to adapt to unseen topics absent from the data, and LLM-based generation methods that lack macro-level distribution awareness, resulting in inconsistencies between micro-level persona attributes and reality. To address these problems, we propose HAG, a Hierarchical Agent Generation framework that formalizes population generation as a two-stage decision process. Firstly, utilizing a World Knowledge Model to infer hierarchical conditional probabilities to construct the Topic-Adaptive Tree, achieving macro-level distribution alignment. Then, grounded real-world data, instantiation and agentic augmentation are carried out to ensure micro-level consistency. Given the lack of specialized evaluation, we establish a multi-domain benchmark and a comprehensive PACE evaluation framework. Extensive experiments show that HAG significantly outperforms representative baselines, reducing population alignment errors by an average of 37.7% and enhancing sociological consistency by 18.8%.", "AI": {"tldr": "HAG\uff1a\u4e00\u79cd\u5206\u5c42\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u751f\u6210\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u4e24\u9636\u6bb5\u51b3\u7b56\u8fc7\u7a0b\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e3b\u9898\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u7684\u4eba\u53e3\u751f\u6210\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u5b8f\u89c2\u5206\u5e03\u5bf9\u9f50\u548c\u5fae\u89c2\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u65b9\u9762\u7684\u4e0d\u8db3\u3002", "motivation": "\u57fa\u4e8e\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u7684\u5efa\u6a21\u9700\u8981\u9ad8\u4fdd\u771f\u7684\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u521d\u59cb\u5316\u3002\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u5b58\u5728\u4e24\u4e2a\u95ee\u9898\uff1a1) \u57fa\u4e8e\u9759\u6001\u6570\u636e\u68c0\u7d22\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u65e0\u6cd5\u9002\u5e94\u6570\u636e\u4e2d\u672a\u89c1\u8fc7\u7684\u4e3b\u9898\uff1b2) \u57fa\u4e8eLLM\u751f\u6210\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u7f3a\u4e4f\u5b8f\u89c2\u5206\u5e03\u610f\u8bc6\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u5fae\u89c2\u4e2a\u4f53\u5c5e\u6027\u4e0e\u73b0\u5b9e\u4e0d\u4e00\u81f4\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faHAG\u5206\u5c42\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u751f\u6210\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5c06\u4eba\u53e3\u751f\u6210\u5f62\u5f0f\u5316\u4e3a\u4e24\u9636\u6bb5\u51b3\u7b56\u8fc7\u7a0b\uff1a1) \u4f7f\u7528\u4e16\u754c\u77e5\u8bc6\u6a21\u578b\u63a8\u65ad\u5206\u5c42\u6761\u4ef6\u6982\u7387\u6784\u5efa\u4e3b\u9898\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u6811\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u5b8f\u89c2\u5206\u5e03\u5bf9\u9f50\uff1b2) \u57fa\u4e8e\u771f\u5b9e\u4e16\u754c\u6570\u636e\u8fdb\u884c\u5b9e\u4f8b\u5316\u548c\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u589e\u5f3a\uff0c\u786e\u4fdd\u5fae\u89c2\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660eHAG\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u4ee3\u8868\u6027\u57fa\u7ebf\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5e73\u5747\u51cf\u5c11\u4eba\u53e3\u5bf9\u9f50\u8bef\u5dee37.7%\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u793e\u4f1a\u5b66\u4e00\u81f4\u602718.8%\u3002\u5efa\u7acb\u4e86\u591a\u9886\u57df\u57fa\u51c6\u548c\u5168\u9762\u7684PACE\u8bc4\u4f30\u6846\u67b6\u3002", "conclusion": "HAG\u6846\u67b6\u901a\u8fc7\u5206\u5c42\u751f\u6210\u65b9\u6cd5\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u521d\u59cb\u5316\u4e2d\u7684\u5b8f\u89c2\u5206\u5e03\u5bf9\u9f50\u548c\u5fae\u89c2\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u4e3a\u57fa\u4e8e\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u7684\u5efa\u6a21\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u66f4\u53ef\u9760\u7684\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u751f\u6210\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

Preprint; work in progress", "summary": "Modern Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems struggle with a fundamental architectural tension: vector indices are optimized for query latency but poorly handle continuous knowledge updates, while data lakes excel at versioning but introduce query latency penalties. We introduce LiveVectorLake, a dual-tier temporal knowledge base architecture that enables real-time semantic search on current knowledge while maintaining complete version history for compliance, auditability, and point-in-time retrieval. The system introduces three core architectural contributions: (1) Content-addressable chunk-level synchronization using SHA-256 hashing for deterministic change detection without external state tracking; (2) Dual-tier storage separating hot-tier vector indices (Milvus with HNSW) from cold-tier columnar versioning (Delta Lake with Parquet), optimizing query latency and storage cost independently; (3) Temporal query routing enabling point-in-time knowledge retrieval via delta-versioning with ACID consistency across tiers. Evaluation on a 100-document corpus versioned across five time points demonstrates: (i) 10-15% re-processing of content during updates compared to 100% for full re-indexing; (ii) sub-100ms retrieval latency on current knowledge; (iii) sub-2s latency for temporal queries across version history; and (iv) storage cost optimization through hot/cold tier separation (only current chunks in expensive vector indices).

Comprehensive evaluation reveals that combining conversation history with reasoning doubles retrieval performance (Baseline .236 $\\rightarrow$ History+Reasoning .479 nDCG@10), while reasoning-specialized models substantially outperform dense encoders.

Yet, equipping domain-specialized models with such reasoning capabilities, referred to as \"Reasoning + X\", remains a significant challenge. While model merging offers a promising training-free solution, existing methods often suffer from a destructive performance collapse: existing methods tend to both weaken reasoning depth and compromise domain-specific utility. Interestingly, we identify a counter-intuitive phenomenon underlying this failure: reasoning ability predominantly resides in parameter regions with low gradient sensitivity, contrary to the common assumption that domain capabilities correspond to high-magnitude parameters. Motivated by this insight, we propose ReasonAny, a novel merging framework that resolves the reasoning-domain performance collapse through Contrastive Gradient Identification. Experiments across safety, biomedicine, and finance domains show that ReasonAny effectively synthesizes \"Reasoning + X\" capabilities, significantly outperforming state-of-the-art baselines while retaining robust reasoning performance.", "AI": {"tldr": "ReasonAny\uff1a\u901a\u8fc7\u5bf9\u6bd4\u68af\u5ea6\u8bc6\u522b\u89e3\u51b3\u63a8\u7406\u4e0e\u9886\u57df\u80fd\u529b\u878d\u5408\u4e2d\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u5d29\u6e83\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u8bad\u7ec3\u81ea\u7531\u7684\"\u63a8\u7406+X\"\u80fd\u529b\u5408\u6210", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u6a21\u578b\u878d\u5408\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u5c06\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\u4e0e\u9886\u57df\u4e13\u7528\u6a21\u578b\u7ed3\u5408\u65f6\u5b58\u5728\u7834\u574f\u6027\u6027\u80fd\u5d29\u6e83\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u65e2\u524a\u5f31\u63a8\u7406\u6df1\u5ea6\u53c8\u635f\u5bb3\u9886\u57df\u7279\u5b9a\u6548\u7528\u3002\u7814\u7a76\u53d1\u73b0\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\u4e3b\u8981\u5b58\u5728\u4e8e\u68af\u5ea6\u654f\u611f\u6027\u4f4e\u7684\u53c2\u6570\u533a\u57df\uff0c\u8fd9\u4e0e\u901a\u5e38\u5047\u8bbe\u9886\u57df\u80fd\u529b\u5bf9\u5e94\u9ad8\u5e45\u5ea6\u53c2\u6570\u7684\u89c2\u70b9\u76f8\u53cd\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faReasonAny\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5bf9\u6bd4\u68af\u5ea6\u8bc6\u522b\u89e3\u51b3\u63a8\u7406-\u9886\u57df\u6027\u80fd\u5d29\u6e83\u95ee\u9898\u3002\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u8bc6\u522b\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\u6240\u5728\u7684\u4f4e\u68af\u5ea6\u654f\u611f\u6027\u53c2\u6570\u533a\u57df\uff0c\u5e76\u4e0e\u9886\u57df\u80fd\u529b\u53c2\u6570\u8fdb\u884c\u6709\u6548\u878d\u5408\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u5b89\u5168\u3001\u751f\u7269\u533b\u5b66\u548c\u91d1\u878d\u9886\u57df\u7684\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0cReasonAny\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u5408\u6210\"\u63a8\u7406+X\"\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u57fa\u7ebf\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u7a33\u5065\u7684\u63a8\u7406\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "conclusion": "ReasonAny\u901a\u8fc7\u63ed\u793a\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\u5b58\u5728\u4e8e\u4f4e\u68af\u5ea6\u654f\u611f\u6027\u53c2\u6570\u533a\u57df\u7684\u53d1\u73b0\uff0c\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u6709\u6548\u7684\u8bad\u7ec3\u81ea\u7531\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u6210\u529f\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u5c06\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\u4e0e\u9886\u57df\u4e13\u7528\u6a21\u578b\u878d\u5408\u65f6\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u5d29\u6e83\u95ee\u9898\u3002"}}

In this paper, we identify a distinct failure mode termed Circular Reasoning. Unlike traditional model degeneration, this phenomenon manifests as a self-reinforcing trap where generated content acts as a logical premise for its own recurrence, compelling the reiteration of preceding text. To systematically analyze this phenomenon, we introduce LoopBench, a dataset designed to capture two distinct loop typologies: numerical loops and statement loops. Mechanistically, we characterize circular reasoning as a state collapse exhibiting distinct boundaries, where semantic repetition precedes textual repetition. We reveal that reasoning impasses trigger the loop onset, which subsequently persists as an inescapable cycle driven by a self-reinforcing V-shaped attention mechanism. Guided by these findings, we employ the Cumulative Sum (CUSUM) algorithm to capture these precursors for early loop prediction.

While observing the decision-making process of these activities is difficult via traditional travel surveys, the advent of new types of data, such as unstructured chat data, can help shed some light on these complex processes. However, interpreting these decision-making processes requires inferring both explicit and implicit factors. This typically involves the labor-intensive task of manually annotating dialogues to capture context-dependent meanings shaped by the social and cultural norms. This study evaluates the potential of Large Language Models (LLMs) to automate and complement human annotation in interpreting decision-making processes from group chats, using data on joint eating-out activities in Japan as a case study. We designed a prompting framework inspired by the knowledge acquisition process, which sequentially extracts key decision-making factors, including the group-level restaurant choice set and outcome, individual preferences of each alternative, and the specific attributes driving those preferences. This structured process guides the LLM to interpret group chat data, converting unstructured dialogues into structured tabular data describing decision-making factors. To evaluate LLM-driven outputs, we conduct a quantitative analysis using a human-annotated ground truth dataset and a qualitative error analysis to examine model limitations. Results show that while the LLM reliably captures explicit decision-making factors, it struggles to identify nuanced implicit factors that human annotators readily identified. We pinpoint specific contexts when LLM-based extraction can be trusted versus when human oversight remains essential.

However, existing approaches rely on a fixed logical formalism, a feature that limits robustness and adaptability. We propose a logic-parametric framework for neuro-symbolic NLI that treats the underlying logic not as a static background, but as a controllable component. Using the LogiKEy methodology, we embed a range of classical and non-classical formalisms into higher-order logic (HOL), enabling a systematic comparison of inference quality, explanation refinement, and proof behavior. We focus on normative reasoning, where the choice of logic has significant implications. In particular, we compare logic-external approaches, where normative requirements are encoded via axioms, with logic-internal approaches, where normative patterns emerge from the logic's built-in structure. Extensive experiments demonstrate that logic-internal strategies can consistently improve performance and produce more efficient hybrid proofs for NLI. In addition, we show that the effectiveness of a logic is domain-dependent, with first-order logic favouring commonsense reasoning, while deontic and modal logics excel in ethical domains. Our results highlight the value of making logic a first-class, parametric element in neuro-symbolic architectures for more robust, modular, and adaptable reasoning.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u79cd\u903b\u8f91\u53c2\u6570\u5316\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5c06\u5e95\u5c42\u903b\u8f91\u4f5c\u4e3a\u53ef\u63a7\u7ec4\u4ef6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7LogiKEy\u65b9\u6cd5\u5c06\u7ecf\u5178\u548c\u975e\u7ecf\u5178\u5f62\u5f0f\u5316\u5d4c\u5165\u9ad8\u9636\u903b\u8f91\uff0c\u7cfb\u7edf\u6bd4\u8f83\u63a8\u7406\u8d28\u91cf\u3001\u89e3\u91ca\u7ec6\u5316\u548c\u8bc1\u660e\u884c\u4e3a\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u5173\u6ce8\u89c4\u8303\u63a8\u7406\u9886\u57df\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u4f9d\u8d56\u56fa\u5b9a\u7684\u903b\u8f91\u5f62\u5f0f\u5316\uff0c\u9650\u5236\u4e86\u795e\u7ecf\u7b26\u53f7\u81ea\u7136\u8bed\u8a00\u63a8\u7406\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u548c\u9002\u5e94\u6027\u3002\u9700\u8981\u4e00\u79cd\u80fd\u591f\u5c06\u903b\u8f91\u4f5c\u4e3a\u53ef\u63a7\u7ec4\u4ef6\u7684\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u4ee5\u652f\u6301\u591a\u79cd\u903b\u8f91\u5f62\u5f0f\u5316\u5e76\u5b9e\u73b0\u66f4\u7075\u6d3b\u3001\u6a21\u5757\u5316\u7684\u63a8\u7406\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u903b\u8f91\u53c2\u6570\u5316\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u57fa\u4e8eLogiKEy\u65b9\u6cd5\u5c06\u7ecf\u5178\u548c\u975e\u7ecf\u5178\u903b\u8f91\u5f62\u5f0f\u5316\u5d4c\u5165\u9ad8\u9636\u903b\u8f91\u3002\u6bd4\u8f83\u903b\u8f91\u5916\u90e8\u65b9\u6cd5\uff08\u901a\u8fc7\u516c\u7406\u7f16\u7801\u89c4\u8303\u8981\u6c42\uff09\u548c\u903b\u8f91\u5185\u90e8\u65b9\u6cd5\uff08\u89c4\u8303\u6a21\u5f0f\u4ece\u903b\u8f91\u5185\u7f6e\u7ed3\u6784\u4e2d\u4ea7\u751f\uff09\u3002\u5728\u89c4\u8303\u63a8\u7406\u9886\u57df\u8fdb\u884c\u5b9e\u9a8c\uff0c\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e0d\u540c\u903b\u8f91\u5728\u63a8\u7406\u8d28\u91cf\u3001\u89e3\u91ca\u7ec6\u5316\u548c\u8bc1\u660e\u884c\u4e3a\u65b9\u9762\u7684\u8868\u73b0\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\u903b\u8f91\u5185\u90e8\u7b56\u7565\u80fd\u6301\u7eed\u63d0\u5347\u6027\u80fd\u5e76\u4ea7\u751f\u66f4\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u6df7\u5408\u8bc1\u660e\u3002\u903b\u8f91\u6709\u6548\u6027\u5177\u6709\u9886\u57df\u4f9d\u8d56\u6027\uff1a\u4e00\u9636\u903b\u8f91\u5728\u5e38\u8bc6\u63a8\u7406\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u66f4\u597d\uff0c\u800c\u9053\u4e49\u903b\u8f91\u548c\u6a21\u6001\u903b\u8f91\u5728\u4f26\u7406\u9886\u57df\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u5f02\u3002\u903b\u8f91\u5185\u90e8\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u89c4\u8303\u63a8\u7406\u4e2d\u4ea7\u751f\u66f4\u7b80\u6d01\u3001\u66f4\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u8bc1\u660e\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5c06\u903b\u8f91\u4f5c\u4e3a\u795e\u7ecf\u7b26\u53f7\u67b6\u6784\u4e2d\u7684\u4e00\u7b49\u53c2\u6570\u5316\u5143\u7d20\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u5b9e\u73b0\u66f4\u9c81\u68d2\u3001\u6a21\u5757\u5316\u548c\u9002\u5e94\u6027\u5f3a\u7684\u63a8\u7406\u3002\u903b\u8f91\u5185\u90e8\u65b9\u6cd5\u4f18\u4e8e\u903b\u8f91\u5916\u90e8\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u4e14\u903b\u8f91\u9009\u62e9\u5e94\u6839\u636e\u5177\u4f53\u9886\u57df\u8fdb\u884c\u8c03\u6574\u3002\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u4e3a\u53ef\u9a8c\u8bc1\u81ea\u7136\u8bed\u8a00\u63a8\u7406\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u66f4\u7075\u6d3b\u7684\u57fa\u7840\u3002"}}

Although there is ample evidence to suggest that pretrained LLMs are well-suited for ranking, we find that the vast majority of LLM-based approaches rely on next-token prediction, a loss function which is fundamentally rank-agnostic (and especially so with pointwise supervision). In this paper, we first prove that the expressivity of pointwise generative ranking with multi-token docIDs is superior to that of dual encoders.

We introduce PII-VisBench, a novel benchmark containing 4000 unique probes designed to evaluate VLM safety through the continuum of online presence. The benchmark stratifies 200 subjects into four visibility categories: high, medium, low, and zero--based on the extent and nature of their information available online. We evaluate 18 open-source VLMs (0.3B-32B) based on two key metrics: percentage of PII probing queries refused (Refusal Rate) and the fraction of non-refusal responses flagged for containing PII (Conditional PII Disclosure Rate). Across models, we observe a consistent pattern: refusals increase and PII disclosures decrease (9.10% high to 5.34% low) as subject visibility drops. We identify that models are more likely to disclose PII for high-visibility subjects, alongside substantial model-family heterogeneity and PII-type disparities. Finally, paraphrasing and jailbreak-style prompts expose attack and model-dependent failures, motivating visibility-aware safety evaluation and training interventions.", "AI": {"tldr": "PII-VisBench\uff1a\u8bc4\u4f30\u89c6\u89c9\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u4e2a\u4eba\u5728\u7ebf\u53ef\u89c1\u5ea6\u8fde\u7eed\u4f53\u4e0a\u7684PII\u6cc4\u9732\u98ce\u9669\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u6a21\u578b\u5bf9\u9ad8\u53ef\u89c1\u5ea6\u4e3b\u4f53\u7684PII\u6cc4\u9732\u7387\u66f4\u9ad8", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709VLM\u9690\u79c1\u8bc4\u4f30\u5c06\u9690\u79c1\u89c6\u4e3a\u9759\u6001\u63d0\u53d6\u4efb\u52a1\uff0c\u5ffd\u7565\u4e86\u4e3b\u4f53\u5728\u7ebf\u5b58\u5728\uff08\u6570\u636e\u53ef\u7528\u91cf\uff09\u5bf9\u9690\u79c1\u5bf9\u9f50\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u5efa\u7acb\u8003\u8651\u5728\u7ebf\u53ef\u89c1\u5ea6\u8fde\u7eed\u4f53\u7684\u5b89\u5168\u8bc4\u4f30\u57fa\u51c6", "method": "\u63d0\u51faPII-VisBench\u57fa\u51c6\uff0c\u5305\u542b4000\u4e2a\u72ec\u7279\u63a2\u9488\uff0c\u5c06200\u4e2a\u4e3b\u4f53\u6309\u5728\u7ebf\u4fe1\u606f\u7a0b\u5ea6\u5206\u4e3a\u9ad8\u3001\u4e2d\u3001\u4f4e\u3001\u96f6\u56db\u4e2a\u53ef\u89c1\u5ea6\u7c7b\u522b\uff0c\u8bc4\u4f3018\u4e2a\u5f00\u6e90VLMs\uff080.3B-32B\uff09\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u62d2\u7edd\u7387\u548c\u6761\u4ef6PII\u6cc4\u9732\u7387\u4e24\u4e2a\u5173\u952e\u6307\u6807", "result": "\u6a21\u578b\u5448\u73b0\u4e00\u81f4\u6a21\u5f0f\uff1a\u968f\u7740\u4e3b\u4f53\u53ef\u89c1\u5ea6\u964d\u4f4e\uff0c\u62d2\u7edd\u7387\u589e\u52a0\uff0cPII\u6cc4\u9732\u7387\u4ece\u9ad8\u53ef\u89c1\u5ea6\u76849.10%\u964d\u81f3\u4f4e\u53ef\u89c1\u5ea6\u76845.34%\uff1b\u6a21\u578b\u66f4\u53ef\u80fd\u6cc4\u9732\u9ad8\u53ef\u89c1\u5ea6\u4e3b\u4f53\u7684PII\uff0c\u5b58\u5728\u663e\u8457\u7684\u6a21\u578b\u5bb6\u65cf\u5f02\u8d28\u6027\u548cPII\u7c7b\u578b\u5dee\u5f02\uff1b\u6539\u8ff0\u548c\u8d8a\u72f1\u5f0f\u63d0\u793a\u66b4\u9732\u4e86\u653b\u51fb\u548c\u6a21\u578b\u4f9d\u8d56\u7684\u5931\u8d25", "conclusion": "\u9700\u8981\u57fa\u4e8e\u53ef\u89c1\u5ea6\u7684\u5b89\u5168\u8bc4\u4f30\u548c\u8bad\u7ec3\u5e72\u9884\uff0c\u4ee5\u89e3\u51b3VLM\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u5728\u7ebf\u5b58\u5728\u7a0b\u5ea6\u4e0b\u7684\u9690\u79c1\u4fdd\u62a4\u5dee\u5f02\u95ee\u9898"}}

While some studies demonstrate that LLMs can achieve high user agreement with ground truth (human) judgments, other studies have argued for the opposite conclusion. To the best of our knowledge, these studies have primarily focused on classic ad-hoc text search scenarios. In this paper, we conduct an analysis on user agreement between LLM and human experts, and explore the impact disagreement has on system rankings. In contrast to prior studies, we focus on a collection composed of audio files that are transcribed into two-minute segments -- the TREC 2020 and 2021 podcast track. We employ five different LLM models to re-assess all of the query-segment pairs, which were originally annotated by TREC assessors. Furthermore, we re-assess a small subset of pairs where LLM and TREC assessors have the highest disagreement, and found that the human experts tend to agree with LLMs more than with the TREC assessors.

This study addresses this critical gap by investigating automatic text detoxification (toxic to neutral rewriting) for two low-resource African languages, isiXhosa and Yor\u00f9b\u00e1. The work contributes a novel, pragmatic hybrid methodology: a lightweight, interpretable TF-IDF and Logistic Regression model for transparent toxicity detection, and a controlled lexicon- and token-guided rewriting component. A parallel corpus of toxic to neutral rewrites, which captures idiomatic usage, diacritics, and code switching, was developed to train and evaluate the model. The detection component achieved stratified K-fold accuracies of 61-72% (isiXhosa) and 72-86% (Yor\u00f9b\u00e1), with per-language ROC-AUCs up to 0.88. The rewriting component successfully detoxified all detected toxic sentences while preserving 100% of non-toxic sentences. These results demonstrate that scalable, interpretable machine learning detectors combined with rule-based edits offer a competitive and resource-efficient solution for culturally adaptive safety tooling, setting a new benchmark for low-resource Text Style Transfer (TST) in African languages.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u9488\u5bf9\u975e\u6d32\u8bed\u8a00\u7f3a\u4e4f\u5728\u7ebf\u5b89\u5168\u5de5\u5177\u7684\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5f00\u53d1\u4e86\u7528\u4e8eisiXhosa\u548cYor\u00f9b\u00e1\u4e24\u79cd\u4f4e\u8d44\u6e90\u8bed\u8a00\u7684\u81ea\u52a8\u6587\u672c\u53bb\u6bd2\u5316\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u91c7\u7528\u6df7\u5408\u65b9\u6cd5\uff1a\u57fa\u4e8eTF-IDF\u548c\u903b\u8f91\u56de\u5f52\u7684\u6bd2\u6027\u68c0\u6d4b\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u4ee5\u53ca\u57fa\u4e8e\u8bcd\u5178\u548c\u6807\u8bb0\u5f15\u5bfc\u7684\u6539\u5199\u7ec4\u4ef6\u3002", "motivation": "\u6709\u6bd2\u8bed\u8a00\u662f\u5728\u7ebf\u5b89\u5168\u53c2\u4e0e\u7684\u4e3b\u8981\u969c\u788d\u4e4b\u4e00\uff0c\u4f46\u9488\u5bf9\u975e\u6d32\u8bed\u8a00\u7684\u7a33\u5065\u7f13\u89e3\u5de5\u5177\u7a00\u7f3a\u3002\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u65e8\u5728\u586b\u8865\u8fd9\u4e00\u5173\u952e\u7a7a\u767d\uff0c\u4e3a\u4e24\u79cd\u4f4e\u8d44\u6e90\u975e\u6d32\u8bed\u8a00\uff08isiXhosa\u548cYor\u00f9b\u00e1\uff09\u5f00\u53d1\u81ea\u52a8\u6587\u672c\u53bb\u6bd2\u5316\u7cfb\u7edf\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u9896\u7684\u5b9e\u7528\u6df7\u5408\u65b9\u6cd5\uff1a1) \u4f7f\u7528\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u3001\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u7684TF-IDF\u548c\u903b\u8f91\u56de\u5f52\u6a21\u578b\u8fdb\u884c\u900f\u660e\u6bd2\u6027\u68c0\u6d4b\uff1b2) \u91c7\u7528\u57fa\u4e8e\u8bcd\u5178\u548c\u6807\u8bb0\u5f15\u5bfc\u7684\u53d7\u63a7\u6539\u5199\u7ec4\u4ef6\u3002\u5f00\u53d1\u4e86\u5305\u542b\u60ef\u7528\u8868\u8fbe\u3001\u53d8\u97f3\u7b26\u53f7\u548c\u8bed\u7801\u8f6c\u6362\u7684\u5e73\u884c\u8bed\u6599\u5e93\u6765\u8bad\u7ec3\u548c\u8bc4\u4f30\u6a21\u578b\u3002", "result": "\u6bd2\u6027\u68c0\u6d4b\u7ec4\u4ef6\u5728\u5206\u5c42K\u6298\u4ea4\u53c9\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e2d\u8fbe\u523061-72%\uff08isiXhosa\uff09\u548c72-86%\uff08Yor\u00f9b\u00e1\uff09\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u7387\uff0c\u6bcf\u79cd\u8bed\u8a00\u7684ROC-AUC\u6700\u9ad8\u8fbe0.88\u3002\u6539\u5199\u7ec4\u4ef6\u6210\u529f\u53bb\u6bd2\u4e86\u6240\u6709\u68c0\u6d4b\u5230\u7684\u6709\u6bd2\u53e5\u5b50\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u7559\u4e86100%\u7684\u975e\u6709\u6bd2\u53e5\u5b50\u3002", "conclusion": "\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u3001\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u7684\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u68c0\u6d4b\u5668\u4e0e\u57fa\u4e8e\u89c4\u5219\u7684\u7f16\u8f91\u76f8\u7ed3\u5408\uff0c\u4e3a\u6587\u5316\u9002\u5e94\u6027\u5b89\u5168\u5de5\u5177\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u5177\u6709\u7ade\u4e89\u529b\u4e14\u8d44\u6e90\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u4e3a\u975e\u6d32\u8bed\u8a00\u7684\u4f4e\u8d44\u6e90\u6587\u672c\u98ce\u683c\u8f6c\u6362\u8bbe\u7acb\u4e86\u65b0\u57fa\u51c6\u3002"}}

Recently, researchers have further investigated Multi-Agent Debate (MAD) frameworks, which enhance the reasoning and collaboration capabilities of MAS through information exchange and debate among multiple agents. However, existing approaches often rely on unguided initialization, causing agents to adopt identical reasoning paths that lead to the same errors. As a result, effective debate among agents is hindered, and the final outcome frequently degenerates into simple majority voting. To solve the above problem, in this paper, we introduce Dynamic Multi-Agent Debate (DynaDebate), which enhances the effectiveness of multi-agent debate through three key mechanisms: (1) Dynamic Path Generation and Allocation, which employs a dedicated Path Generation Agent to generate diverse and logical solution paths with adaptive redundancy; (2) Process-Centric Debate, which shifts the focus from surface-level outcome voting to rigorous step-by-step logic critique to ensure process correctness; (3) A Trigger-Based Verification Agent, which is activated upon disagreement and uses external tools to objectively resolve deadlocks.

This gap arises from a lack of informal learning, which thrives on interactive feedback rather than goal-oriented instruction. In this paper, we propose treating Games as a primary environment for LLM informal learning, leveraging their intrinsic reward signals and abstracted complexity to cultivate diverse competencies. To address the performance degradation observed in multi-task learning, we introduce a Nested Training Framework. Unlike naive task mixing optimizing an implicit \"OR\" objective, our framework employs sequential task composition to enforce an explicit \"AND\" objective, compelling the model to master multiple abilities simultaneously to achieve maximal rewards. Using GRPO-based reinforcement learning across Matrix Games, TicTacToe, and Who's the Spy games, we demonstrate that integrating game-based informal learning not only prevents task interference but also significantly bolsters the model's generalization across broad ability-oriented benchmarks. The framework and implementation are publicly available.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u5c06\u6e38\u620f\u4f5c\u4e3aLLM\u975e\u6b63\u5f0f\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u4e3b\u8981\u73af\u5883\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5d4c\u5957\u8bad\u7ec3\u6846\u67b6\u89e3\u51b3\u591a\u4efb\u52a1\u5b66\u4e60\u4e2d\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u9000\u5316\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b", "motivation": "\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u5f62\u5f0f\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u4efb\u52a1\uff08\u5982\u6570\u5b66\u548c\u4ee3\u7801\u751f\u6210\uff09\u4e0a\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u8272\uff0c\u4f46\u5728\"\u5b9e\u8df5\u667a\u6167\"\u548c\u6cdb\u5316\u667a\u80fd\uff08\u5982\u6218\u7565\u521b\u9020\u529b\u548c\u793e\u4ea4\u63a8\u7406\uff09\u65b9\u9762\u4ecd\u5b58\u5728\u4e0d\u8db3\uff0c\u8fd9\u6e90\u4e8e\u7f3a\u4e4f\u975e\u6b63\u5f0f\u5b66\u4e60\u3002\u975e\u6b63\u5f0f\u5b66\u4e60\u4f9d\u8d56\u4e8e\u4ea4\u4e92\u53cd\u9988\u800c\u975e\u76ee\u6807\u5bfc\u5411\u7684\u6307\u4ee4\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u5c06\u6e38\u620f\u4f5c\u4e3aLLM\u975e\u6b63\u5f0f\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u4e3b\u8981\u73af\u5883\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u5176\u5185\u5728\u5956\u52b1\u4fe1\u53f7\u548c\u62bd\u8c61\u590d\u6742\u6027\u57f9\u517b\u591a\u6837\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u3002\u4e3a\u89e3\u51b3\u591a\u4efb\u52a1\u5b66\u4e60\u4e2d\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u9000\u5316\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5f15\u5165\u5d4c\u5957\u8bad\u7ec3\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u987a\u5e8f\u4efb\u52a1\u7ec4\u5408\u5f3a\u5236\u6267\u884c\u660e\u786e\u7684\"AND\"\u76ee\u6807\uff0c\u8feb\u4f7f\u6a21\u578b\u540c\u65f6\u638c\u63e1\u591a\u79cd\u80fd\u529b\u4ee5\u83b7\u5f97\u6700\u5927\u5956\u52b1\u3002\u4f7f\u7528\u57fa\u4e8eGRPO\u7684\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u5728\u77e9\u9635\u6e38\u620f\u3001\u4e95\u5b57\u68cb\u548c\"\u8c01\u662f\u5367\u5e95\"\u6e38\u620f\u4e2d\u5b9e\u65bd\u3002", "result": "\u96c6\u6210\u57fa\u4e8e\u6e38\u620f\u7684\u975e\u6b63\u5f0f\u5b66\u4e60\u4e0d\u4ec5\u80fd\u9632\u6b62\u4efb\u52a1\u5e72\u6270\uff0c\u8fd8\u80fd\u663e\u8457\u589e\u5f3a\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u5e7f\u6cdb\u80fd\u529b\u5bfc\u5411\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\u7684\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "conclusion": "\u6e38\u620f\u73af\u5883\u4e3aLLM\u975e\u6b63\u5f0f\u5b66\u4e60\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u6709\u6548\u5e73\u53f0\uff0c\u5d4c\u5957\u8bad\u7ec3\u6846\u67b6\u901a\u8fc7\u5f3a\u5236\u6a21\u578b\u540c\u65f6\u638c\u63e1\u591a\u79cd\u80fd\u529b\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u591a\u4efb\u52a1\u5b66\u4e60\u4e2d\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u9000\u5316\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u6cdb\u5316\u667a\u80fd\u3002"}}

Top-performing CUAs are framework-based systems that decompose planning and execution, while end-to-end screenshot-to-action policies are easier to deploy but lag behind on benchmarks such as OSWorld-Verified. GUI datasets like OSWorld pose two bottlenecks: they expose only a few hundred interactive, verifiable tasks and environments, and expert trajectories must be gathered by interacting with these environments, making such data hard to scale. We therefore ask how reinforcement learning from verifiable rewards (RLVR) can best exploit a small pool of exist expert trajectories to train end-to-end policies. Naively mixing these off-policy traces into on-policy RLVR is brittle: even after format conversion, expert trajectories exhibit structural mismatch and distribution shift from the learner. We propose BEPA (Bi-Level Expert-to-Policy Assimilation), which turns static expert traces into policy-aligned guidance via self-rolled reachable trajectories under the base policy (LEVEL-1) and a per-task, dynamically updated cache used in RLVR (LEVEL-2). On OSWorld-Verified, BEPA improves UITARS1.5-7B success from 22.87% to 32.13% and raises a held-out split from 5.74% to 10.30%, with consistent gains on MMBench-GUI and Online-Mind2Web.

In this work, we study multilingual unlearning using the Aya-Expanse 8B model under two settings: (1) data unlearning and (2) concept unlearning. We extend benchmarks for factual knowledge and stereotypes to ten languages through translation: English, French, Arabic, Japanese, Russian, Farsi, Korean, Hindi, Hebrew, and Indonesian. These languages span five language families and a wide range of resource levels. Our experiments show that unlearning in high-resource languages is generally more stable, with asymmetric transfer effects observed between typologically related languages. Furthermore, our analysis of linguistic distances indicates that syntactic similarity is the strongest predictor of cross-lingual unlearning behavior.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u63a2\u8ba8\u4e86\u591a\u8bed\u8a00\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\u7684\u9057\u5fd8\u5b66\u4e60\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u6269\u5c55\u4e86\u73b0\u6709\u5355\u8bed\u9057\u5fd8\u5b66\u4e60\u7814\u7a76\u5230\u591a\u8bed\u8a00\u73af\u5883\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528Aya-Expanse 8B\u6a21\u578b\u572810\u79cd\u8bed\u8a00\u4e0a\u8fdb\u884c\u6570\u636e\u9057\u5fd8\u548c\u6982\u5ff5\u9057\u5fd8\u5b9e\u9a8c\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u9ad8\u8d44\u6e90\u8bed\u8a00\u9057\u5fd8\u66f4\u7a33\u5b9a\uff0c\u53e5\u6cd5\u76f8\u4f3c\u6027\u662f\u8de8\u8bed\u8a00\u9057\u5fd8\u884c\u4e3a\u7684\u6700\u4f73\u9884\u6d4b\u6307\u6807\u3002", "motivation": "\u968f\u7740\u591a\u8bed\u8a00\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u5e7f\u6cdb\u5e94\u7528\uff0c\u786e\u4fdd\u5176\u5728\u591a\u6837\u5316\u8bed\u8a00\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u7684\u5b89\u5168\u6027\u548c\u516c\u5e73\u6027\u9762\u4e34\u72ec\u7279\u6311\u6218\u3002\u73b0\u6709\u673a\u5668\u9057\u5fd8\u7814\u7a76\u4e3b\u8981\u96c6\u4e2d\u4e8e\u5355\u8bed\u73af\u5883\uff08\u901a\u5e38\u662f\u82f1\u8bed\uff09\uff0c\u800c\u591a\u8bed\u8a00\u73af\u5883\u7531\u4e8e\u8de8\u8bed\u8a00\u77e5\u8bc6\u8f6c\u79fb\u4ee5\u53ca\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u548c\u5fae\u8c03\u6570\u636e\u4e2d\u5d4c\u5165\u7684\u504f\u89c1\u800c\u5f15\u5165\u989d\u5916\u590d\u6742\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528Aya-Expanse 8B\u6a21\u578b\u7814\u7a76\u591a\u8bed\u8a00\u9057\u5fd8\u5b66\u4e60\uff0c\u8bbe\u7f6e\u4e24\u79cd\u5b9e\u9a8c\uff1a(1) \u6570\u636e\u9057\u5fd8\u548c(2) \u6982\u5ff5\u9057\u5fd8\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u7ffb\u8bd1\u5c06\u4e8b\u5b9e\u77e5\u8bc6\u548c\u523b\u677f\u5370\u8c61\u57fa\u51c6\u6269\u5c55\u523010\u79cd\u8bed\u8a00\uff1a\u82f1\u8bed\u3001\u6cd5\u8bed\u3001\u963f\u62c9\u4f2f\u8bed\u3001\u65e5\u8bed\u3001\u4fc4\u8bed\u3001\u6ce2\u65af\u8bed\u3001\u97e9\u8bed\u3001\u5370\u5730\u8bed\u3001\u5e0c\u4f2f\u6765\u8bed\u548c\u5370\u5c3c\u8bed\uff0c\u8fd9\u4e9b\u8bed\u8a00\u6db5\u76d6\u4e94\u4e2a\u8bed\u7cfb\u548c\u5e7f\u6cdb\u7684\u8d44\u6e90\u6c34\u5e73\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u9ad8\u8d44\u6e90\u8bed\u8a00\u7684\u9057\u5fd8\u5b66\u4e60\u901a\u5e38\u66f4\u7a33\u5b9a\uff0c\u5728\u7c7b\u578b\u5b66\u76f8\u5173\u8bed\u8a00\u4e4b\u95f4\u89c2\u5bdf\u5230\u4e0d\u5bf9\u79f0\u7684\u8f6c\u79fb\u6548\u5e94\u3002\u5bf9\u8bed\u8a00\u8ddd\u79bb\u7684\u5206\u6790\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u53e5\u6cd5\u76f8\u4f3c\u6027\u662f\u8de8\u8bed\u8a00\u9057\u5fd8\u884c\u4e3a\u7684\u6700\u5f3a\u9884\u6d4b\u6307\u6807\u3002", "conclusion": "\u591a\u8bed\u8a00\u9057\u5fd8\u5b66\u4e60\u5b58\u5728\u8bed\u8a00\u95f4\u5dee\u5f02\uff0c\u9ad8\u8d44\u6e90\u8bed\u8a00\u9057\u5fd8\u66f4\u7a33\u5b9a\uff0c\u53e5\u6cd5\u76f8\u4f3c\u6027\u5bf9\u8de8\u8bed\u8a00\u9057\u5fd8\u884c\u4e3a\u5177\u6709\u91cd\u8981\u9884\u6d4b\u4f5c\u7528\uff0c\u8fd9\u4e3a\u591a\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u5b89\u5168\u6027\u548c\u516c\u5e73\u6027\u4f18\u5316\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u91cd\u8981\u89c1\u89e3\u3002"}}

However, central agents often suffer from unstable long-horizon collaboration due to the lack of memory management, leading to context bloat, error accumulation, and poor cross-task generalization. To address both task-level memory inefficiency and the inability to reuse coordination experience, we propose StackPlanner, a hierarchical multi-agent framework with explicit memory control. StackPlanner addresses these challenges by decoupling high-level coordination from subtask execution with active task-level memory control, and by learning to retrieve and exploit reusable coordination experience via structured experience memory and reinforcement learning. Experiments on multiple deep-search and agent system benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach in enabling reliable long-horizon multi-agent collaboration.", "AI": {"tldr": "StackPlanner\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u5177\u6709\u663e\u5f0f\u5185\u5b58\u63a7\u5236\u7684\u5206\u5c42\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u89e3\u8026\u9ad8\u5c42\u534f\u8c03\u4e0e\u5b50\u4efb\u52a1\u6267\u884c\uff0c\u5e76\u5229\u7528\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u7ecf\u9a8c\u8bb0\u5fc6\u548c\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u91cd\u7528\u534f\u8c03\u7ecf\u9a8c\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u957f\u65f6\u7a0b\u534f\u4f5c\u4e2d\u7684\u5185\u5b58\u7ba1\u7406\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "motivation": "\u57fa\u4e8e\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u7cfb\u7edf\uff08\u7279\u522b\u662f\u96c6\u4e2d\u5f0f\u67b6\u6784\uff09\u5728\u590d\u6742\u77e5\u8bc6\u5bc6\u96c6\u578b\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u6f5c\u529b\uff0c\u4f46\u4e2d\u592e\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u7531\u4e8e\u7f3a\u4e4f\u5185\u5b58\u7ba1\u7406\uff0c\u5e38\u9762\u4e34\u957f\u65f6\u7a0b\u534f\u4f5c\u4e0d\u7a33\u5b9a\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u81a8\u80c0\u3001\u9519\u8bef\u7d2f\u79ef\u548c\u8de8\u4efb\u52a1\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u5dee\u3002\u9700\u8981\u540c\u65f6\u89e3\u51b3\u4efb\u52a1\u7ea7\u5185\u5b58\u6548\u7387\u4f4e\u4e0b\u548c\u65e0\u6cd5\u91cd\u7528\u534f\u8c03\u7ecf\u9a8c\u7684\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faStackPlanner\u5206\u5c42\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5177\u6709\u663e\u5f0f\u5185\u5b58\u63a7\u5236\uff1a1\uff09\u901a\u8fc7\u4e3b\u52a8\u4efb\u52a1\u7ea7\u5185\u5b58\u63a7\u5236\u89e3\u8026\u9ad8\u5c42\u534f\u8c03\u4e0e\u5b50\u4efb\u52a1\u6267\u884c\uff1b2\uff09\u901a\u8fc7\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u7ecf\u9a8c\u8bb0\u5fc6\u548c\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u5b66\u4e60\u68c0\u7d22\u548c\u5229\u7528\u53ef\u91cd\u7528\u7684\u534f\u8c03\u7ecf\u9a8c\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u6df1\u5ea6\u641c\u7d22\u548c\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u7cfb\u7edf\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e0a\u7684\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8bc1\u660e\u4e86\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u5b9e\u73b0\u53ef\u9760\u957f\u65f6\u7a0b\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u534f\u4f5c\u65b9\u9762\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "StackPlanner\u901a\u8fc7\u663e\u5f0f\u5185\u5b58\u63a7\u5236\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u957f\u65f6\u7a0b\u534f\u4f5c\u7684\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u4efb\u52a1\u7ea7\u5185\u5b58\u6548\u7387\u63d0\u5347\u548c\u534f\u8c03\u7ecf\u9a8c\u91cd\u7528\uff0c\u4e3a\u590d\u6742\u77e5\u8bc6\u5bc6\u96c6\u578b\u4efb\u52a1\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u53ef\u9760\u7684\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u534f\u4f5c\u6846\u67b6\u3002"}}

To address this problem, we propose a context-aware user profiling framework with two trainable components: a query generator that generates optimal queries to retrieve persuasion-relevant records from a user's history, and a profiler that summarizes these records into a profile to effectively inform the persuasiveness prediction model. Our evaluation on the ChangeMyView Reddit dataset shows consistent improvements over existing methods across multiple predictor models, with gains of up to +13.77%p in F1 score.

Real-time strategy (RTS) games serve as an ideal testbed for evaluating these two capabilities, as their inherent gameplay requires both macro-level strategic planning and micro-level tactical adaptation and action execution. Existing RTS game-based environments either suffer from relatively high computational demands or lack support for textual observations, which has constrained the use of RTS games for LLM evaluation. Motivated by this, we present TowerMind, a novel environment grounded in the tower defense (TD) subgenre of RTS games. TowerMind preserves the key evaluation strengths of RTS games for assessing LLMs, while featuring low computational demands and a multimodal observation space, including pixel-based, textual, and structured game-state representations. In addition, TowerMind supports the evaluation of model hallucination and provides a high degree of customizability. We design five benchmark levels to evaluate several widely used LLMs under different multimodal input settings. The results reveal a clear performance gap between LLMs and human experts across both capability and hallucination dimensions. The experiments further highlight key limitations in LLM behavior, such as inadequate planning validation, a lack of multifinality in decision-making, and inefficient action use. We also evaluate two classic reinforcement learning algorithms: Ape-X DQN and PPO. By offering a lightweight and multimodal design, TowerMind complements the existing RTS game-based environment landscape and introduces a new benchmark for the AI agent field.

Yet, most embodied AI research overlooks this, assuming instructions are clear and focusing on execution rather than confirmation. To address this critical safety gap, we are the first to define Open-Vocabulary 3D Instruction Ambiguity Detection, a fundamental new task where a model must determine if a command has a single, unambiguous meaning within a given 3D scene. To support this research, we build Ambi3D, the large-scale benchmark for this task, featuring over 700 diverse 3D scenes and around 22k instructions. Our analysis reveals a surprising limitation: state-of-the-art 3D Large Language Models (LLMs) struggle to reliably determine if an instruction is ambiguous. To address this challenge, we propose AmbiVer, a two-stage framework that collects explicit visual evidence from multiple views and uses it to guide an vision-language model (VLM) in judging instruction ambiguity. Extensive experiments demonstrate the challenge of our task and the effectiveness of AmbiVer, paving the way for safer and more trustworthy embodied AI.

We introduce Afri-MCQA, the first Multilingual Cultural Question-Answering benchmark covering 7.5k Q&A pairs across 15 African languages from 12 countries. The benchmark offers parallel English-African language Q&A pairs across text and speech modalities and was entirely created by native speakers. Benchmarking large language models (LLMs) on Afri-MCQA shows that open-weight models perform poorly across evaluated cultures, with near-zero accuracy on open-ended VQA when queried in native language or speech. To evaluate linguistic competence, we include control experiments meant to assess this specific aspect separate from cultural knowledge, and we observe significant performance gaps between native languages and English for both text and speech. These findings underscore the need for speech-first approaches, culturally grounded pretraining, and cross-lingual cultural transfer.

In-context learning (ICL) with large language models (LLMs) addresses this problem, but prior work largely focuses on high-resource languages covered during training and text-only settings. This paper investigates whether speech LLMs can learn unseen languages with multimodal ICL (MICL), and how this learning can be used to improve ASR. We conduct experiments with two speech LLMs, Phi-4 and Qwen3-Omni, on three diverse endangered languages. Firstly, we find that MICL is effective for unseen languages, leveraging both speech and text modalities. We further show that cross-lingual transfer learning improves MICL efficiency on target languages without training on them. Moreover, we analyze attention patterns to interpret MICL mechanisms, and we observe layer-dependent preferences between audio and text context, with an overall bias towards text. Finally, we show that prompt-based ASR with speech LLMs performs poorly on unseen languages, motivating a simple ASR system that combines a stronger acoustic model with a speech LLM via MICL-based selection of acoustic hypotheses. Results show that MICL consistently improves ASR performance, and that cross-lingual transfer learning matches or outperforms corpus-trained language models without using target-language data.

Many existing methods extract word embeddings from an LLM, visualise the embedding space via point-plots, and compare the relative positions of certain words. However, this approach only considers single words and not whole natural language expressions, thus disregards the context in which a word is used. Here we present a novel tool for analysing and visualising information flow in natural language expressions by applying diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) to word embeddings. We find that DTI reveals how information flows between word embeddings. Tracking information flows within the layers of an LLM allows for comparing different model structures and revealing opportunities for pruning an LLM's under-utilised layers. Furthermore, our model reveals differences in information flows for tasks like pronoun resolution and metaphor detection.

It is therefore essential to understand how user instructions affect the generation of persuasive language, and to understand whether the generated persuasive language differs, for example, when targeting different groups. In this work, we propose a framework for evaluating how persuasive language generation is affected by recipient gender, sender intent, or output language. We evaluate 13 LLMs and 16 languages using pairwise prompt instructions. We evaluate model responses on 19 categories of persuasive language using an LLM-as-judge setup grounded in social psychology and communication science. Our results reveal significant gender differences in the persuasive language generated across all models.

We evaluate monitors using two complementary metrics: Miss Rate (MR) and False Alarm Rate (FAR), capturing failures to detect misbehavior and oversensitivity to benign behavior, respectively. Evaluating 12 proprietary and 10 open-source LLMs, we observe substantial variability in monitoring performance and a consistent trade-off between MR and FAR, revealing an inherent safety-utility tension. To further explore the limits of monitor reliability, we construct a large-scale training corpus of 153,581 samples and fine-tune Qwen3-4B-Instruction to investigate whether training on known, relatively easy-to-construct misbehavior datasets improves monitoring performance on unseen and more implicit misbehaviors.

On Pretraining Romanized Encoder Language Models", "comment": null, "summary": "Exposing latent lexical overlap, script romanization has emerged as an effective strategy for improving cross-lingual transfer (XLT) in multilingual language models (mLMs). Most prior work, however, focused on setups that favor romanization the most: (1) transfer from high-resource Latin-script to low-resource non-Latin-script languages and/or (2) between genealogically closely related languages with different scripts. It thus remains unclear whether romanization is a good representation choice for pretraining general-purpose mLMs, or, more precisely, if information loss associated with romanization harms performance for high-resource languages. We address this gap by pretraining encoder LMs from scratch on both romanized and original texts for six typologically diverse high-resource languages, investigating two potential sources of degradation: (i) loss of script-specific information and (ii) negative cross-lingual interference from increased vocabulary overlap. Using two romanizers with different fidelity profiles, we observe negligible performance loss for languages with segmental scripts, whereas languages with morphosyllabic scripts (Chinese and Japanese) suffer degradation that higher-fidelity romanization mitigates but cannot fully recover. Importantly, comparing monolingual LMs with their mLM counterpart, we find no evidence that increased subword overlap induces negative interference. We further show that romanization improves encoding efficiency (i.e., fertility) for segmental scripts at a negligible performance cost.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e86\u7f57\u9a6c\u5316\u5bf9\u591a\u8bed\u8a00\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u5728\u9ad8\u8d44\u6e90\u8bed\u8a00\u4e2d\uff0c\u7f57\u9a6c\u5316\u5bf9\u97f3\u7d20\u6587\u5b57\u8bed\u8a00\u6027\u80fd\u5f71\u54cd\u53ef\u5ffd\u7565\uff0c\u4f46\u5bf9\u8bed\u7d20\u97f3\u8282\u6587\u5b57\uff08\u4e2d\u6587\u3001\u65e5\u6587\uff09\u4f1a\u9020\u6210\u6027\u80fd\u4e0b\u964d\uff0c\u4e14\u589e\u52a0\u8bcd\u6c47\u91cd\u53e0\u4e0d\u4f1a\u5bfc\u81f4\u8d1f\u5411\u5e72\u6270\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u7814\u7a76\u4e3b\u8981\u5173\u6ce8\u7f57\u9a6c\u5316\u5728\u62c9\u4e01\u6587\u5b57\u5230\u975e\u62c9\u4e01\u6587\u5b57\u3001\u6216\u8c31\u7cfb\u76f8\u8fd1\u8bed\u8a00\u95f4\u7684\u8de8\u8bed\u8a00\u8fc1\u79fb\u4f18\u52bf\uff0c\u4f46\u7f3a\u4e4f\u5bf9\u7f57\u9a6c\u5316\u4f5c\u4e3a\u901a\u7528\u591a\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u7b56\u7565\u7684\u5168\u9762\u8bc4\u4f30\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u7f57\u9a6c\u5316\u53ef\u80fd\u5bfc\u81f4\u7684\u4fe1\u606f\u635f\u5931\u662f\u5426\u4f1a\u5bf9\u9ad8\u8d44\u6e90\u8bed\u8a00\u6027\u80fd\u4ea7\u751f\u8d1f\u9762\u5f71\u54cd\u3002", "method": "\u4ece\u96f6\u5f00\u59cb\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u7f16\u7801\u5668\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5bf9\u516d\u79cd\u7c7b\u578b\u591a\u6837\u7684\u9ad8\u8d44\u6e90\u8bed\u8a00\u5206\u522b\u4f7f\u7528\u7f57\u9a6c\u5316\u548c\u539f\u59cb\u6587\u672c\u8fdb\u884c\u8bad\u7ec3\u3002\u4f7f\u7528\u4e24\u79cd\u4fdd\u771f\u5ea6\u4e0d\u540c\u7684\u7f57\u9a6c\u5316\u5de5\u5177\uff0c\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e24\u4e2a\u6f5c\u5728\u6027\u80fd\u4e0b\u964d\u6765\u6e90\uff1a(i) \u811a\u672c\u7279\u5b9a\u4fe1\u606f\u635f\u5931\uff1b(ii) \u8bcd\u6c47\u91cd\u53e0\u589e\u52a0\u5bfc\u81f4\u7684\u8d1f\u5411\u8de8\u8bed\u8a00\u5e72\u6270\u3002\u6bd4\u8f83\u5355\u8bed\u6a21\u578b\u4e0e\u591a\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u8868\u73b0\u3002", "result": "\u97f3\u7d20\u6587\u5b57\u8bed\u8a00\uff08\u5982\u82f1\u8bed\u3001\u4fc4\u8bed\uff09\u7f57\u9a6c\u5316\u540e\u6027\u80fd\u635f\u5931\u53ef\u5ffd\u7565\uff0c\u800c\u8bed\u7d20\u97f3\u8282\u6587\u5b57\uff08\u4e2d\u6587\u3001\u65e5\u6587\uff09\u6027\u80fd\u4e0b\u964d\u660e\u663e\uff0c\u66f4\u9ad8\u4fdd\u771f\u5ea6\u7684\u7f57\u9a6c\u5316\u5de5\u5177\u53ef\u7f13\u89e3\u4f46\u65e0\u6cd5\u5b8c\u5168\u6062\u590d\u6027\u80fd\u3002\u591a\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u4e0e\u5355\u8bed\u6a21\u578b\u5bf9\u6bd4\u663e\u793a\uff0c\u589e\u52a0\u5b50\u8bcd\u91cd\u53e0\u4e0d\u4f1a\u5bfc\u81f4\u8d1f\u5411\u5e72\u6270\u3002\u7f57\u9a6c\u5316\u8fd8\u80fd\u63d0\u9ad8\u97f3\u7d20\u6587\u5b57\u8bed\u8a00\u7684\u7f16\u7801\u6548\u7387\uff08\u751f\u80b2\u7387\uff09\u3002", "conclusion": "\u7f57\u9a6c\u5316\u4f5c\u4e3a\u591a\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u7b56\u7565\u9700\u8c28\u614e\uff1a\u5bf9\u97f3\u7d20\u6587\u5b57\u8bed\u8a00\u662f\u53ef\u884c\u7684\uff0c\u4f46\u5bf9\u8bed\u7d20\u97f3\u8282\u6587\u5b57\u4f1a\u9020\u6210\u6027\u80fd\u635f\u5931\u3002\u7f57\u9a6c\u5316\u5e26\u6765\u7684\u8bcd\u6c47\u91cd\u53e0\u589e\u52a0\u4e0d\u4f1a\u5bfc\u81f4\u8d1f\u5411\u8de8\u8bed\u8a00\u5e72\u6270\uff0c\u4e14\u80fd\u63d0\u9ad8\u7f16\u7801\u6548\u7387\u3002\u672a\u6765\u7814\u7a76\u5e94\u8003\u8651\u5f00\u53d1\u66f4\u4fdd\u771f\u7684\u7f57\u9a6c\u5316\u65b9\u6cd5\u6216\u6df7\u5408\u8868\u793a\u7b56\u7565\u3002"}}

A human evaluation favors fine-tuned outputs overall.

However, access to real systems is often restricted; LLM-simulated environments are prone to hallucinations and inconsistencies; and manually built sandboxes are hard to scale. In this paper, we propose EnvScaler, an automated framework for scalable tool-interaction environments via programmatic synthesis. EnvScaler comprises two components. First, SkelBuilder constructs diverse environment skeletons through topic mining, logic modeling, and quality evaluation. Then, ScenGenerator generates multiple task scenarios and rule-based trajectory validation functions for each environment. With EnvScaler, we synthesize 191 environments and about 7K scenarios, and apply them to Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) and Reinforcement Learning (RL) for Qwen3 series models. Results on three benchmarks show that EnvScaler significantly improves LLMs' ability to solve tasks in complex environments involving multi-turn, multi-tool interactions.

Evaluating LLM Framing in News Classification and Generation", "comment": null, "summary": "Large Language Model (LLM) based summarization and text generation are increasingly used for producing and rewriting text, raising concerns about political framing in journalism where subtle wording choices can shape interpretation. Across nine state-of-the-art LLMs, we study political framing by testing whether LLMs' classification-based bias signals align with framing behavior in their generated summaries. We first compare few-shot ideology predictions against LEFT/CENTER/RIGHT labels.

We introduce Multimodal Auto-Completion (MAC), a task that predicts upcoming characters in live chats using partially typed text and visual cues. Unlike traditional text-only auto-completion (TAC), MAC grounds predictions in multimodal context to better capture user intent. To enable this task, we adapt MMDialog and ImageChat to create benchmark datasets. We evaluate leading vision-language models (VLMs) against strong textual baselines, highlighting trade-offs in accuracy and efficiency. We present Router-Suggest, a router framework that dynamically selects between textual models and VLMs based on dialog context, along with a lightweight variant for resource-constrained environments. Router-Suggest achieves a 2.3x to 10x speedup over the best-performing VLM. A user study shows that VLMs significantly excel over textual models on user satisfaction, notably saving user typing effort and improving the quality of completions in multi-turn conversations.

Some follow-up works further improved MT performance via preference optimization, but they leave a key aspect largely underexplored: the order in which data samples are given during training. We address this topic by integrating curriculum learning into various state-of-the-art preference optimization algorithms to boost MT performance. We introduce a novel curriculum learning strategy with restarts (CLewR), which reiterates easy-to-hard curriculum multiple times during training to effectively mitigate the catastrophic forgetting of easy examples. We demonstrate consistent gains across several model families (Gemma2, Qwen2.5, Llama3.1) and preference optimization techniques.

Existing work often attributes hallucination to a simple over-reliance on the model's parametric knowledge. We challenge this view and introduce FACTUM (Framework for Attesting Citation Trustworthiness via Underlying Mechanisms), a framework of four mechanistic scores measuring the distinct contributions of a model's attention and FFN pathways, and the alignment between them. Our analysis reveals two consistent signatures of correct citation: a significantly stronger contribution from the model's parametric knowledge and greater use of the attention sink for information synthesis. Crucially, we find the signature of a correct citation is not static but evolves with model scale. For example, the signature of a correct citation for the Llama-3.2-3B model is marked by higher pathway alignment, whereas for the Llama-3.1-8B model, it is characterized by lower alignment, where pathways contribute more distinct, orthogonal information. By capturing this complex, evolving signature, FACTUM outperforms state-of-the-art baselines by up to 37.5% in AUC.

We propose iReasoner, a self-evolving framework that improves an LMM's implicit reasoning by explicitly eliciting chain-of-thought (CoT) and rewarding its internal agreement. In a Proposer--Solver loop over unlabeled images, iReasoner augments outcome-level intrinsic rewards with a trajectory-aware signal defined over intermediate reasoning steps, providing learning signals that distinguish reasoning paths leading to the same answer without ground-truth labels or external judges. Starting from Qwen2.5-VL-7B, iReasoner yields up to $+2.1$ points across diverse multimodal reasoning benchmarks under fully unsupervised post-training.

Laypeople use these tools intuitively, which may lead them to form expectations based on incomplete, incorrect, or biased outputs. This study examines whether leading LLMs exhibit gender bias in their responses to a realistic family law scenario. We present an expert-designed divorce scenario grounded in Czech family law and evaluate four state-of-the-art LLMs GPT-5 nano, Claude Haiku 4.5, Gemini 2.5 Flash, and Llama 3.3 in a fully zero-shot interaction. We deploy two versions of the scenario, one with gendered names and one with neutral labels, to establish a baseline for comparison. We further introduce nine legally relevant factors that vary the factual circumstances of the case and test whether these variations influence the models' proposed shared-parenting ratios. Our preliminary results highlight differences across models and suggest gender-dependent patterns in the outcomes generated by some systems. The findings underscore both the risks associated with laypeople's reliance on LLMs for legal guidance and the need for more robust evaluation of model behavior in sensitive legal contexts.

Diagnosing LLM Truthfulness via Neighborhood Consistency", "comment": "Work in progress", "summary": "As Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed in real-world settings, correctness alone is insufficient. Reliable deployment requires maintaining truthful beliefs under contextual perturbations. Existing evaluations largely rely on point-wise confidence like Self-Consistency, which can mask brittle belief. We show that even facts answered with perfect self-consistency can rapidly collapse under mild contextual interference. To address this gap, we propose Neighbor-Consistency Belief (NCB), a structural measure of belief robustness that evaluates response coherence across a conceptual neighborhood. To validate the efficiency of NCB, we introduce a new cognitive stress-testing protocol that probes outputs stability under contextual interference. Experiments across multiple LLMs show that the performance of high-NCB data is relatively more resistant to interference. Finally, we present Structure-Aware Training (SAT), which optimizes context-invariant belief structure and reduces long-tail knowledge brittleness by approximately 30%.

Analysis of distilled trajectories reveals these structures emerge from Long CoT fine-tuning, not keyword imitation.

Drawing on these findings, we present Mole-Syn, a distribution-transfer-graph method that guides synthesis of effective Long CoT structures, boosting performance and RL stability across benchmarks.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u957f\u94fe\u601d\u7ef4\u63a8\u7406\u7684\u5206\u5b50\u7ed3\u6784\u7406\u8bba\uff0c\u8ba4\u4e3a\u6709\u6548\u7684\u957f\u94fe\u601d\u7ef4\u8f68\u8ff9\u5177\u6709\u7c7b\u4f3c\u5206\u5b50\u7684\u7a33\u5b9a\u7ed3\u6784\uff0c\u5305\u542b\u4e09\u79cd\u76f8\u4e92\u4f5c\u7528\u7c7b\u578b\uff0c\u5e76\u57fa\u4e8e\u6b64\u5f00\u53d1\u4e86Mole-Syn\u65b9\u6cd5\u6765\u63d0\u5347\u957f\u94fe\u601d\u7ef4\u63a8\u7406\u6027\u80fd", "motivation": "\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u4ece\u4eba\u7c7b\u6216\u975e\u957f\u94fe\u601d\u7ef4\u6a21\u578b\u6a21\u4eff\u5b66\u4e60\u65f6\uff0c\u5f80\u5f80\u96be\u4ee5\u638c\u63e1\u6709\u6548\u7684\u957f\u94fe\u601d\u7ef4\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\u3002\u9700\u8981\u7406\u89e3\u957f\u94fe\u601d\u7ef4\u63a8\u7406\u7684\u672c\u8d28\u7279\u5f81\uff0c\u4ee5\u89e3\u51b3\u8fd9\u4e00\u5b66\u4e60\u96be\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u957f\u94fe\u601d\u7ef4\u8f68\u8ff9\u7684\u5206\u5b50\u7ed3\u6784\u7406\u8bba\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5305\u542b\u6df1\u5ea6\u63a8\u7406\uff08\u5171\u4ef7\u952e\u5f0f\uff09\u3001\u81ea\u6211\u53cd\u601d\uff08\u6c22\u952e\u5f0f\uff09\u548c\u81ea\u6211\u63a2\u7d22\uff08\u8303\u5fb7\u534e\u5f0f\uff09\u4e09\u79cd\u76f8\u4e92\u4f5c\u7528\u7c7b\u578b\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u5206\u6790\u84b8\u998f\u8f68\u8ff9\u9a8c\u8bc1\u7ed3\u6784\u7279\u5f81\uff0c\u5f15\u5165\u6709\u6548\u8bed\u4e49\u5f02\u6784\u4f53\u6982\u5ff5\uff0c\u5e76\u5f00\u53d1Mole-Syn\u5206\u5e03\u8f6c\u79fb\u56fe\u65b9\u6cd5\u6765\u6307\u5bfc\u5408\u6210\u6709\u6548\u7684\u957f\u94fe\u601d\u7ef4\u7ed3\u6784\u3002", "result": "\u5206\u6790\u53d1\u73b0\u957f\u94fe\u601d\u7ef4\u5fae\u8c03\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e2d\u4f1a\u81ea\u53d1\u5f62\u6210\u5206\u5b50\u72b6\u7ed3\u6784\uff0c\u800c\u975e\u7b80\u5355\u7684\u5173\u952e\u8bcd\u6a21\u4eff\u3002\u53ea\u6709\u4fc3\u8fdb\u5feb\u901f\u71b5\u6536\u655b\u7684\u952e\u5408\u7c7b\u578b\u624d\u80fd\u652f\u6301\u7a33\u5b9a\u7684\u957f\u94fe\u601d\u7ef4\u5b66\u4e60\uff0c\u800c\u7ed3\u6784\u7ade\u4e89\u4f1a\u635f\u5bb3\u8bad\u7ec3\u6548\u679c\u3002Mole-Syn\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u6027\u80fd\u548c\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u957f\u94fe\u601d\u7ef4\u63a8\u7406\u7684\u6709\u6548\u5b66\u4e60\u4f9d\u8d56\u4e8e\u7279\u5b9a\u7684\u5206\u5b50\u72b6\u7ed3\u6784\u7279\u5f81\uff0c\u7406\u89e3\u8fd9\u4e9b\u7ed3\u6784\u7279\u5f81\u5bf9\u4e8e\u5f00\u53d1\u66f4\u6709\u6548\u7684\u957f\u94fe\u601d\u7ef4\u8bad\u7ec3\u65b9\u6cd5\u81f3\u5173\u91cd\u8981\u3002\u63d0\u51fa\u7684Mole-Syn\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e3a\u5408\u6210\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf\u957f\u94fe\u601d\u7ef4\u8f68\u8ff9\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u7406\u8bba\u6307\u5bfc\u3002"}}

Inference-time ensembling provides a practical way to combine these capabilities without retraining. However, existing ensemble approaches suffer from fundamental limitations. Most rely on fixed fusion granularity, which lacks the flexibility required for mid-generation adaptation and fails to adapt to different generation characteristics across tasks. To address these challenges, we propose AdaFuse, an adaptive ensemble decoding framework that dynamically selects semantically appropriate fusion units during generation. Rather than committing to a fixed granularity, AdaFuse adjusts fusion behavior on the fly based on the decoding context, with words serving as basic building blocks for alignment. To be specific, we introduce an uncertainty-based criterion to decide whether to apply ensembling at each decoding step. Under confident decoding states, the model continues generation directly. In less certain states, AdaFuse invokes a diversity-aware scaling strategy to explore alternative candidate continuations and inform ensemble decisions. This design establishes a synergistic interaction between adaptive ensembling and test-time scaling, where ensemble decisions guide targeted exploration, and the resulting diversity in turn strengthens ensemble quality. Experiments on open-domain question answering, arithmetic reasoning, and machine translation demonstrate that AdaFuse consistently outperforms strong ensemble baselines, achieving an average relative improvement of 6.88%.
