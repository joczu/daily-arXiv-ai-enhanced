*Ankan Aich,Yangming Lee*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出一种基于Depth Anything V2架构的单目深度估计方法，通过动态向量低秩适应技术将合成先验知识高效迁移到医学领域，在手术内窥镜环境下显著提升深度估计精度，特别是在高反射区域和薄手术器械的边界保持方面。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统自监督单目深度估计方法在充满镜面反射和液体的内窥镜手术环境中表现脆弱，特别是在薄手术器械和透明表面容易出现边界塌陷问题。现有方法通常依赖带有噪声真实世界伪标签的基础模型，难以准确捕捉精细几何细节。

Result: 在SCARED数据集上达到新的最先进水平：准确度(<1.25)达到98.1%，平方相对误差比现有基线降低超过17%。在不利手术光照条件下表现出卓越的鲁棒性。

Conclusion: 通过利用Depth Anything V2的合成先验知识和动态向量低秩适应技术，成功解决了内窥镜手术环境中单目深度估计的挑战，特别是在高反射区域和薄手术器械边界保持方面取得了显著改进，为机器人手术提供了更可靠的深度感知能力。

Abstract: Accurate Monocular Depth Estimation (MDE) is critical for robotic surgery but remains fragile in specular, fluid-filled endoscopic environments. Existing self-supervised methods, typically relying on foundation models trained with noisy real-world pseudo-labels, often suffer from boundary collapse on thin surgical tools and transparent surfaces. In this work, we address this by leveraging the high-fidelity synthetic priors of the Depth Anything V2 architecture, which inherently captures precise geometric details of thin structures. We efficiently adapt these priors to the medical domain using Dynamic Vector Low-Rank Adaptation (DV-LORA), minimizing the parameter budget while bridging the synthetic-to-real gap. Additionally, we introduce a physically-stratified evaluation protocol on the SCARED dataset to rigorously quantify performance in high-specularity regimes often masked by aggregate metrics. Our approach establishes a new state-of-the-art, achieving an accuracy (< 1.25) of 98.1% and reducing Squared Relative Error by over 17% compared to established baselines, demonstrating superior robustness in adverse surgical lighting.

### [2] [Nonlinear Noise2Noise for Efficient Monte Carlo Denoiser Training](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.24794)
*Andrew Tinits,Stephen Mann*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种改进Noise2Noise训练的方法，允许对噪声目标图像应用特定非线性函数而不引入显著偏差，解决了HDR图像去噪中训练被异常值淹没的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Noise2Noise方法虽然无需干净目标图像，但存在主要限制：对噪声目标应用非线性函数会导致结果偏差。由于非线性函数在图像处理中很常见，这限制了可对噪声目标进行的预处理类型。特别是在高动态范围(HDR)图像去噪中，训练过程容易被异常值淹没而表现不佳。

Method: 开发了理论框架分析非线性函数的影响，描述了一类具有最小偏差的非线性函数。针对HDR图像去噪，研究了特定损失函数和色调映射函数的组合，这些组合可以减少异常值影响同时引入最小偏差。将该方法应用于现有的基于机器学习的蒙特卡洛去噪器。

Result: 该方法在HDR图像去噪上取得了接近原始实现（使用高样本数参考图像训练）的结果，但仅使用噪声训练数据。证明了特定非线性函数可以应用于噪声目标而不引入显著偏差。

Conclusion: 某些非线性函数可以应用于Noise2Noise训练中的噪声目标图像而不引入显著偏差，这扩展了Noise2Noise方法的适用性，特别是在处理HDR图像时，可以通过适当的非线性预处理解决异常值问题。

Abstract: The Noise2Noise method allows for training machine learning-based denoisers with pairs of input and target images where both the input and target can be noisy. This removes the need for training with clean target images, which can be difficult to obtain. However, Noise2Noise training has a major limitation: nonlinear functions applied to the noisy targets will skew the results. This bias occurs because the nonlinearity makes the expected value of the noisy targets different from the clean target image. Since nonlinear functions are common in image processing, avoiding them limits the types of preprocessing that can be performed on the noisy targets. Our main insight is that certain nonlinear functions can be applied to the noisy targets without adding significant bias to the results. We develop a theoretical framework for analyzing the effects of these nonlinearities, and describe a class of nonlinear functions with minimal bias.
  We demonstrate our method on the denoising of high dynamic range (HDR) images produced by Monte Carlo rendering. Noise2Noise training can have trouble with HDR images, where the training process is overwhelmed by outliers and performs poorly. We consider a commonly used method of addressing these training issues: applying a nonlinear tone mapping function to the model output and target images to reduce their dynamic range. This method was previously thought to be incompatible with Noise2Noise training because of the nonlinearities involved. We show that certain combinations of loss functions and tone mapping functions can reduce the effect of outliers while introducing minimal bias. We apply our method to an existing machine learning-based Monte Carlo denoiser, where the original implementation was trained with high-sample count reference images. Our results approach those of the original implementation, but are produced using only noisy training data.

TL;DR: 提出基于视频的自动评估管道，利用计算机视觉从训练视频中提取骨骼、视线和轨迹数据，开发特定任务指标评估心理运动流畅性、情境意识和团队协调，通过加权组合生成团队合作与认知的总体表现分数。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 城市作战训练需要情境意识和肌肉记忆，但传统评估方法依赖昂贵传感器或主观观察，难以实现客观、可扩展的认知、心理运动和团队技能评估。

Method: 使用计算机视觉模型从训练视频提取2D骨骼、视线向量和运动轨迹，开发任务特定指标测量心理运动流畅性、情境意识和团队协调，通过扩展的认知任务分析层次结构进行加权组合生成总体表现分数。

Conclusion: 视频分析可实现合成训练环境中可扩展的自动评估，但存在跟踪困难、地面真实验证等限制，未来工作包括扩展到3D视频数据。

Abstract: Effective urban warfare training requires situational awareness and muscle memory, developed through repeated practice in realistic yet controlled environments. A key drill, Enter and Clear the Room (ECR), demands threat assessment, coordination, and securing confined spaces. The military uses Synthetic Training Environments that offer scalable, controlled settings for repeated exercises. However, automatic performance assessment remains challenging, particularly when aiming for objective evaluation of cognitive, psychomotor, and teamwork skills. Traditional methods often rely on costly, intrusive sensors or subjective human observation, limiting scalability and accuracy. This paper introduces a video-based assessment pipeline that derives performance analytics from training videos without requiring additional hardware. By utilizing computer vision models, the system extracts 2D skeletons, gaze vectors, and movement trajectories. From these data, we develop task-specific metrics that measure psychomotor fluency, situational awareness, and team coordination. These metrics feed into an extended Cognitive Task Analysis (CTA) hierarchy, which employs a weighted combination to generate overall performance scores for teamwork and cognition. We demonstrate the approach with a case study of real-world ECR drills, providing actionable, domain specific metrics that capture individual and team performance. We also discuss how these insights can support After Action Reviews with interactive dashboards within Gamemaster and the Generalized Intelligent Framework for Tutoring (GIFT), providing intuitive and understandable feedback. We conclude by addressing limitations, including tracking difficulties, ground-truth validation, and the broader applicability of our approach. Future work includes expanding analysis to 3D video data and leveraging video analysis to enable scalable evaluation within STEs.

### [4] [Lifelong Domain Adaptive 3D Human Pose Estimation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.23860)
*Qucheng Peng,Hongfei Xue,Pu Wang,Chen Chen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出终身领域自适应3D人体姿态估计新任务，通过GAN框架整合3D姿态生成器、2D姿态判别器和3D姿态估计器，解决非平稳目标数据集和灾难性遗忘问题


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有3D人体姿态估计方法依赖受控环境标注数据，难以泛化到真实场景。传统领域自适应方法（通用DA和源自由DA）忽略了目标姿态数据集的非平稳性问题，需要解决连续适应多个目标域时的灾难性遗忘挑战

Method: 提出终身领域自适应3D HPE任务，设计创新GAN框架：包含3D姿态生成器、2D姿态判别器和3D姿态估计器。构建新型3D姿态生成器范式，整合姿态感知、时序感知和领域感知知识，增强当前领域适应并缓解对先前领域的遗忘

Conclusion: 首次将终身领域自适应引入3D HPE任务，提出的GAN框架和3D姿态生成器范式能有效解决非平稳目标数据集适应和灾难性遗忘问题，为3D人体姿态估计在真实场景中的应用提供了新思路

Abstract: 3D Human Pose Estimation (3D HPE) is vital in various applications, from person re-identification and action recognition to virtual reality. However, the reliance on annotated 3D data collected in controlled environments poses challenges for generalization to diverse in-the-wild scenarios. Existing domain adaptation (DA) paradigms like general DA and source-free DA for 3D HPE overlook the issues of non-stationary target pose datasets. To address these challenges, we propose a novel task named lifelong domain adaptive 3D HPE. To our knowledge, we are the first to introduce the lifelong domain adaptation to the 3D HPE task. In this lifelong DA setting, the pose estimator is pretrained on the source domain and subsequently adapted to distinct target domains. Moreover, during adaptation to the current target domain, the pose estimator cannot access the source and all the previous target domains. The lifelong DA for 3D HPE involves overcoming challenges in adapting to current domain poses and preserving knowledge from previous domains, particularly combating catastrophic forgetting. We present an innovative Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) framework, which incorporates 3D pose generators, a 2D pose discriminator, and a 3D pose estimator. This framework effectively mitigates domain shifts and aligns original and augmented poses. Moreover, we construct a novel 3D pose generator paradigm, integrating pose-aware, temporal-aware, and domain-aware knowledge to enhance the current domain's adaptation and alleviate catastrophic forgetting on previous domains. Our method demonstrates superior performance through extensive experiments on diverse domain adaptive 3D HPE datasets.

### [5] [MRI-to-CT Synthesis With Cranial Suture Segmentations Using A Variational Autoencoder Framework](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.23894)
*Krithika Iyer,Austin Tapp,Athelia Paulli,Gabrielle Dickerson,Syed Muhammad Anwar,Natasha Lepore,Marius George Linguraru*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出基于深度学习的儿科MRI转合成CT框架，实现颅骨分割和骨缝可视化，解决儿童颅骨发育评估中CT辐射与MRI骨结构显示不足的矛盾。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 儿科颅骨发育和骨缝骨化的量化评估对诊断生长相关颅脑疾病至关重要。CT虽能评估颅骨和骨缝畸形，但电离辐射对无明显异常的儿童存在禁忌。MRI无辐射且软组织对比度好，但无法显示颅骨骨缝、评估骨密度或颅骨生长。需要一种非侵入性方法在MRI基础上获得类似CT的骨结构信息。

Method: 提出深度学习驱动的流程：将0.2-2岁儿童的T1加权MRI转换为合成CT(sCT)，预测详细的颅骨分割，生成骨缝概率热图，并从热图直接获得骨缝分割。采用领域特定的变分自编码器，生成与真实CT感知上难以区分的颅骨sCT。

Result: sCT与真实CT的结构相似度达99%，Fréchet起始距离为1.01。七个颅骨的平均Dice系数为85%，骨缝分割Dice系数达80%。通过双侧等价性检验(TOST p<0.05)确认sCT与真实CT在颅骨和骨缝分割上的等效性。

Conclusion: 这是首个能从MRI衍生的合成CT进行骨缝分割的儿科颅骨CT合成框架，克服了MRI对骨和骨缝显示有限的缺陷，为无创颅骨评估填补了关键空白。

Abstract: Quantifying normative pediatric cranial development and suture ossification is crucial for diagnosing and treating growth-related cephalic disorders. Computed tomography (CT) is widely used to evaluate cranial and sutural deformities; however, its ionizing radiation is contraindicated in children without significant abnormalities. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) offers radiation free scans with superior soft tissue contrast, but unlike CT, MRI cannot elucidate cranial sutures, estimate skull bone density, or assess cranial vault growth. This study proposes a deep learning driven pipeline for transforming T1 weighted MRIs of children aged 0.2 to 2 years into synthetic CTs (sCTs), predicting detailed cranial bone segmentation, generating suture probability heatmaps, and deriving direct suture segmentation from the heatmaps. With our in-house pediatric data, sCTs achieved 99% structural similarity and a Frechet inception distance of 1.01 relative to real CTs. Skull segmentation attained an average Dice coefficient of 85% across seven cranial bones, and sutures achieved 80% Dice. Equivalence of skull and suture segmentation between sCTs and real CTs was confirmed using two one sided tests (TOST p < 0.05). To our knowledge, this is the first pediatric cranial CT synthesis framework to enable suture segmentation on sCTs derived from MRI, despite MRI's limited depiction of bone and sutures. By combining robust, domain specific variational autoencoders, our method generates perceptually indistinguishable cranial sCTs from routine pediatric MRIs, bridging critical gaps in non invasive cranial evaluation.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出MGML框架解决多模态MRI数据不完整时的脑肿瘤分割问题，通过元参数化自适应模态融合和一致性正则化模块，在不改变原模型架构的情况下提升分割性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 临床实践中多模态MRI数据常不完整，难以充分利用可用信息，因此最大化利用不完整多模态信息成为关键研究挑战。

Method: 提出元引导多模态学习框架，包含元参数化自适应模态融合和一致性正则化模块。Meta-AMF根据可用模态生成自适应软标签监督信号，促进更一致的多模态融合；一致性正则化模块增强分割性能并提升框架鲁棒性和泛化能力。

Result: 在BraTS2020和BraTS2023数据集上实验，相比多种先进方法取得更优性能。在BraTS2020上，15种缺失模态组合的平均Dice分数：全肿瘤87.55、肿瘤核心79.36、增强肿瘤62.67。

Conclusion: MGML框架能有效处理不完整多模态MRI数据，提升脑肿瘤分割性能，且不改变原模型架构，可方便集成到训练流程中进行端到端优化。

Abstract: Leveraging multimodal information from Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) plays a vital role in lesion segmentation, especially for brain tumors. However, in clinical practice, multimodal MRI data are often incomplete, making it challenging to fully utilize the available information. Therefore, maximizing the utilization of this incomplete multimodal information presents a crucial research challenge. We present a novel meta-guided multi-modal learning (MGML) framework that comprises two components: meta-parameterized adaptive modality fusion and consistency regularization module. The meta-parameterized adaptive modality fusion (Meta-AMF) enables the model to effectively integrate information from multiple modalities under varying input conditions. By generating adaptive soft-label supervision signals based on the available modalities, Meta-AMF explicitly promotes more coherent multimodal fusion. In addition, the consistency regularization module enhances segmentation performance and implicitly reinforces the robustness and generalization of the overall framework. Notably, our approach does not alter the original model architecture and can be conveniently integrated into the training pipeline for end-to-end model optimization. We conducted extensive experiments on the public BraTS2020 and BraTS2023 datasets. Compared to multiple state-of-the-art methods from previous years, our method achieved superior performance. On BraTS2020, for the average Dice scores across fifteen missing modality combinations, building upon the baseline, our method obtained scores of 87.55, 79.36, and 62.67 for the whole tumor (WT), the tumor core (TC), and the enhancing tumor (ET), respectively. We have made our source code publicly available at https://github.com/worldlikerr/MGML.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 神经外科微血管吻合术需要精细操作技能，传统评估依赖专家主观评价，存在评分者间变异、不一致性和时间成本高等问题，需要自动化、可扩展的客观评估方案

Method: 提出三层AI框架：1) 基于YOLO和DeepSORT的目标尖端跟踪定位模块；2) 基于自相似矩阵的动作边界检测和无监督聚类的动作分割模块；3) 评估手术手势熟练度的监督分类模块

Conclusion: 该方法能够为显微外科教育提供客观、实时的反馈，实现更标准化、数据驱动的训练方案，提升高风险手术环境中的能力评估水平

Abstract: Proficiency in microanastomosis is a critical surgical skill in neurosurgery, where the ability to precisely manipulate fine instruments is crucial to successful outcomes. These procedures require sustained attention, coordinated hand movements, and highly refined motor skills, underscoring the need for objective and systematic methods to evaluate and enhance microsurgical training. Conventional assessment approaches typically rely on expert raters supervising the procedures or reviewing surgical videos, which is an inherently subjective process prone to inter-rater variability, inconsistency, and significant time investment. These limitations highlight the necessity for automated and scalable solutions. To address this challenge, we introduce a novel AI-driven framework for automated action segmentation and performance assessment in microanastomosis procedures, designed to operate efficiently on edge computing platforms. The proposed system comprises three main components: (1) an object tip tracking and localization module based on YOLO and DeepSORT; (2) an action segmentation module leveraging self-similarity matrix for action boundary detection and unsupervised clustering; and (3) a supervised classification module designed to evaluate surgical gesture proficiency. Experimental validation on a dataset of 58 expert-rated microanastomosis videos demonstrates the effectiveness of our approach, achieving a frame-level action segmentation accuracy of 92.4% and an overall skill classification accuracy of 85.5% in replicating expert evaluations. These findings demonstrate the potential of the proposed method to provide objective, real-time feedback in microsurgical education, thereby enabling more standardized, data-driven training protocols and advancing competency assessment in high-stakes surgical environments.

*Changzhen Li,Yuecong Min,Jie Zhang,Zheng Yuan,Shiguang Shan,Xilin Chen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: T2VAttack：针对文本到视频扩散模型的对抗攻击研究，从语义和时间两个角度评估模型脆弱性，通过替换或插入关键词实现攻击。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管文本到视频扩散模型在生成高质量视频方面取得显著进展，但其对抗攻击脆弱性尚未得到充分研究。考虑到视频数据的动态特性，需要从语义和时间两个维度评估模型安全性。

Method: 提出两种攻击方法：1) T2VAttack-S：识别提示词中语义或时间关键词语，通过贪婪搜索替换为同义词；2) T2VAttack-I：迭代插入优化词语，对提示词进行最小扰动。两种方法分别针对语义目标（评估视频-文本对齐）和时间目标（评估时间动态性）。

Result: 在多个先进T2V模型（ModelScope、CogVideoX、Open-Sora、HunyuanVideo）上的实验表明，即使单个词语的替换或插入也能导致语义保真度和时间动态性的显著下降，揭示了当前T2V扩散模型的关键脆弱性。

Conclusion: 当前文本到视频扩散模型对对抗攻击高度脆弱，即使是微小的提示词修改也能显著影响生成质量。这突显了提高T2V模型鲁棒性的必要性，并为未来防御机制设计提供了重要见解。

Abstract: The rapid evolution of Text-to-Video (T2V) diffusion models has driven remarkable advancements in generating high-quality, temporally coherent videos from natural language descriptions. Despite these achievements, their vulnerability to adversarial attacks remains largely unexplored. In this paper, we introduce T2VAttack, a comprehensive study of adversarial attacks on T2V diffusion models from both semantic and temporal perspectives. Considering the inherently dynamic nature of video data, we propose two distinct attack objectives: a semantic objective to evaluate video-text alignment and a temporal objective to assess the temporal dynamics. To achieve an effective and efficient attack process, we propose two adversarial attack methods: (i) T2VAttack-S, which identifies semantically or temporally critical words in prompts and replaces them with synonyms via greedy search, and (ii) T2VAttack-I, which iteratively inserts optimized words with minimal perturbation to the prompt. By combining these objectives and strategies, we conduct a comprehensive evaluation on the adversarial robustness of several state-of-the-art T2V models, including ModelScope, CogVideoX, Open-Sora, and HunyuanVideo. Our experiments reveal that even minor prompt modifications, such as the substitution or insertion of a single word, can cause substantial degradation in semantic fidelity and temporal dynamics, highlighting critical vulnerabilities in current T2V diffusion models.

Conclusion: 提出了一种无需昂贵先验信息的自动驾驶场景视图外推解决方案，通过4D高斯模型与扩散模型的协同优化实现高质量外推视图生成

Abstract: This paper presents an effective solution for view extrapolation in autonomous driving scenarios. Recent approaches focus on generating shifted novel view images from given viewpoints using diffusion models. However, these methods heavily rely on priors such as LiDAR point clouds, 3D bounding boxes, and lane annotations, which demand expensive sensors or labor-intensive labeling, limiting applicability in real-world deployment. In this work, with only images and optional camera poses, we first estimate a global static point cloud and per-frame dynamic point clouds, fusing them into a unified representation. We then employ a deformable 4D Gaussian framework to reconstruct the scene. The initially trained 4D Gaussian model renders degraded and pseudo-images to train a video diffusion model. Subsequently, progressively shifted Gaussian renderings are iteratively refined by the diffusion model,and the enhanced results are incorporated back as training data for 4DGS. This process continues until extrapolation reaches the target viewpoints. Compared with baselines, our method produces higher-quality images at novel extrapolated viewpoints.

Motivation: 卫星影像地表变化检测对灾害响应和环境监测至关重要，但受大气噪声、季节变化和传感器伪影等复杂因素影响，传统方法难以实现高灵敏度检测

Method: 使用SATLAS基础模型构建修复模型，利用全球分布的Sentinel-2时间序列数据训练，通过预测无变化情况下的地表状态，比较预测与观测的差异来检测异常

Conclusion: 该方法为利用免费多光谱卫星数据实现自动化、全球尺度的地表变化监测提供了可行路径，能够检测传统方法遗漏的异常变化

Abstract: Detecting surface changes from satellite imagery is critical for rapid disaster response and environmental monitoring, yet remains challenging due to the complex interplay between atmospheric noise, seasonal variations, and sensor artifacts. Here we show that deep learning can leverage the temporal redundancy of satellite time series to detect anomalies at unprecedented sensitivity, by learning to predict what the surface should look like in the absence of change. We train an inpainting model built upon the SATLAS foundation model to reconstruct the last frame of a Sentinel-2 time series from preceding acquisitions, using globally distributed training data spanning diverse climate zones and land cover types. When applied to regions affected by sudden surface changes, the discrepancy between prediction and observation reveals anomalies that traditional change detection methods miss. We validate our approach on earthquake-triggered surface ruptures from the 2023 Turkey-Syria earthquake sequence, demonstrating detection of a rift feature in Tepehan with higher sensitivity and specificity than temporal median or Reed-Xiaoli anomaly detectors. Our method reaches detection thresholds approximately three times lower than baseline approaches, providing a path towards automated, global-scale monitoring of surface changes from freely available multi-spectral satellite data.

TL;DR: GASeg是一个自监督语义分割框架，通过引入几何拓扑信息来解决外观模糊性问题，使用可微盒计数模块和拓扑增强策略，在多个基准测试中达到SOTA性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 自监督语义分割方法在面对外观模糊性（如阴影、眩光、局部纹理）时经常失败，这是因为过度依赖不稳定的外观特征。需要引入更稳定的几何拓扑信息来弥补这一缺陷。

Method: 提出GASeg框架，核心是Differentiable Box-Counting (DBC)模块，从几何特征流和外观特征流中量化多尺度拓扑统计信息。引入Topological Augmentation (TopoAug)对抗策略，通过形态学操作模拟真实世界模糊性。使用GALoss多目标损失函数显式强制跨模态对齐。

Conclusion: 通过引入稳定的拓扑信息来桥接几何和外观特征，能够有效解决自监督语义分割中的外观模糊性问题，GASeg框架为此提供了有效的解决方案。

Abstract: Self-supervised semantic segmentation methods often fail when faced with appearance ambiguities. We argue that this is due to an over-reliance on unstable, appearance-based features such as shadows, glare, and local textures. We propose \textbf{GASeg}, a novel framework that bridges appearance and geometry by leveraging stable topological information. The core of our method is Differentiable Box-Counting (\textbf{DBC}) module, which quantifies multi-scale topological statistics from two parallel streams: geometric-based features and appearance-based features. To force the model to learn these stable structural representations, we introduce Topological Augmentation (\textbf{TopoAug}), an adversarial strategy that simulates real-world ambiguities by applying morphological operators to the input images. A multi-objective loss, \textbf{GALoss}, then explicitly enforces cross-modal alignment between geometric-based and appearance-based features. Extensive experiments demonstrate that GASeg achieves state-of-the-art performance on four benchmarks, including COCO-Stuff, Cityscapes, and PASCAL, validating our approach of bridging geometry and appearance via topological information.

Abstract: This work presents a novel pipeline to recover the 3D structure of an unknown target spacecraft from a sequence of images captured during Rendezvous and Proximity Operations (RPO) in space. The target's geometry and appearance are represented as a 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) model. However, learning 3DGS requires static scenes, an assumption in contrast to dynamic lighting conditions encountered in spaceborne imagery. The trained 3DGS model can also be used for camera pose estimation through photometric optimization. Therefore, in addition to recovering a geometrically accurate 3DGS model, the photometric accuracy of the rendered images is imperative to downstream pose estimation tasks during the RPO process. This work proposes to incorporate the prior knowledge of the Sun's position, estimated and maintained by the servicer spacecraft, into the training pipeline for improved photometric quality of 3DGS rasterization. Experimental studies demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed solution, as 3DGS models trained on a sequence of images learn to adapt to rapidly changing illumination conditions in space and reflect global shadowing and self-occlusion.

Abstract: Recent methods in flow-based diffusion editing have enabled direct transformations between source and target image distribution without explicit inversion. However, the latent trajectories in these methods often exhibit accumulated velocity errors, leading to semantic inconsistency and loss of structural fidelity. We propose Conditioned Velocity Correction (CVC), a principled framework that reformulates flow-based editing as a distribution transformation problem driven by a known source prior. CVC rethinks the role of velocity in inter-distribution transformation by introducing a dual-perspective velocity conversion mechanism. This mechanism explicitly decomposes the latent evolution into two components: a structure-preserving branch that remains consistent with the source trajectory, and a semantically-guided branch that drives a controlled deviation toward the target distribution. The conditional velocity field exhibits an absolute velocity error relative to the true underlying distribution trajectory, which inherently introduces potential instability and trajectory drift in the latent space. To address this quantifiable deviation and maintain fidelity to the true flow, we apply a posterior-consistent update to the resulting conditional velocity field. This update is derived from Empirical Bayes Inference and Tweedie correction, which ensures a mathematically grounded error compensation over time. Our method yields stable and interpretable latent dynamics, achieving faithful reconstruction alongside smooth local semantic conversion. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that CVC consistently achieves superior fidelity, better semantic alignment, and more reliable editing behavior across diverse tasks.

TL;DR: FitControler是一个可学习的插件，能够集成到现代虚拟试穿模型中，实现定制化的服装合身度控制，解决了现有方法忽视服装合身度这一关键风格因素的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有虚拟试穿方法主要关注服装细节的忠实渲染，但忽视了塑造整体风格的关键因素——服装合身度。合身度定义了服装与穿着者身体的贴合方式，是时尚设计的基本要素，对整体风格协调至关重要。

Abstract: Realistic virtual try-on (VTON) concerns not only faithful rendering of garment details but also coordination of the style. Prior art typically pursues the former, but neglects a key factor that shapes the holistic style -- garment fit. Garment fit delineates how a garment aligns with the body of a wearer and is a fundamental element in fashion design. In this work, we introduce fit-aware VTON and present FitControler, a learnable plug-in that can seamlessly integrate into modern VTON models to enable customized fit control. To achieve this, we highlight two challenges: i) how to delineate layouts of different fits and ii) how to render the garment that matches the layout. FitControler first features a fit-aware layout generator to redraw the body-garment layout conditioned on a set of delicately processed garment-agnostic representations, and a multi-scale fit injector is then used to deliver layout cues to enable layout-driven VTON. In particular, we build a fit-aware VTON dataset termed Fit4Men, including 13,000 body-garment pairs of different fits, covering both tops and bottoms, and featuring varying camera distances and body poses. Two fit consistency metrics are also introduced to assess the fitness of generations. Extensive experiments show that FitControler can work with various VTON models and achieve accurate fit control. Code and data will be released.

TL;DR: 提出结构引导的2D高斯泼溅分配方法，通过结构感知初始化、自适应位宽量化和几何一致性正则化，显著提升2DGS的率失真性能，同时保持毫秒级解码速度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有2D高斯泼溅方法在表示容量和参数精度分配时忽略了图像结构信息，导致在低比特率下的率失真效率受限。需要一种能够显式耦合图像结构与表示容量/量化精度的方案。

Method: 1. 结构引导初始化：基于自然图像的空间结构先验分配2D高斯分布，获得局部化且语义有意义的分布；2. 自适应位宽量化：在量化感知微调中，对协方差参数进行自适应位宽量化，复杂区域的小尺度高斯赋予更高精度；3. 几何一致性正则化：对齐高斯方向与局部梯度方向以更好保持结构细节。

Result: 方法显著提升了2DGS的表示能力和率失真性能，同时保持超过1000 FPS的解码速度。相比基线GSImage，在Kodak数据集上BD-rate降低43.44%，在DIV2K数据集上降低29.91%。

Conclusion: 提出的结构引导分配原则有效解决了2DGS在低比特率下的率失真效率问题，通过显式耦合图像结构与表示容量/量化精度，实现了性能提升与解码速度的平衡。

Abstract: Recent advances in 2D Gaussian Splatting (2DGS) have demonstrated its potential as a compact image representation with millisecond-level decoding. However, existing 2DGS-based pipelines allocate representation capacity and parameter precision largely oblivious to image structure, limiting their rate-distortion (RD) efficiency at low bitrates. To address this, we propose a structure-guided allocation principle for 2DGS, which explicitly couples image structure with both representation capacity and quantization precision, while preserving native decoding speed. First, we introduce a structure-guided initialization that assigns 2D Gaussians according to spatial structural priors inherent in natural images, yielding a localized and semantically meaningful distribution. Second, during quantization-aware fine-tuning, we propose adaptive bitwidth quantization of covariance parameters, which grants higher precision to small-scale Gaussians in complex regions and lower precision elsewhere, enabling RD-aware optimization, thereby reducing redundancy without degrading edge quality. Third, we impose a geometry-consistent regularization that aligns Gaussian orientations with local gradient directions to better preserve structural details. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach substantially improves both the representational power and the RD performance of 2DGS while maintaining over 1000 FPS decoding. Compared with the baseline GSImage, we reduce BD-rate by 43.44% on Kodak and 29.91% on DIV2K.

Abstract: Large vision-language models (VLMs) exhibit strong performance across various tasks. However, these VLMs encounter significant challenges when applied to the remote sensing domain due to the inherent differences between remote sensing images and natural images. Existing remote sensing VLMs often fail to extract fine-grained visual features and suffer from visual forgetting during deep language processing. To address this, we introduce MF-RSVLM, a Multi-Feature Fusion Remote Sensing Vision--Language Model that effectively extracts and fuses visual features for RS understanding. MF-RSVLM learns multi-scale visual representations and combines global context with local details, improving the capture of small and complex structures in RS scenes. A recurrent visual feature injection scheme ensures the language model remains grounded in visual evidence and reduces visual forgetting during generation. Extensive experiments on diverse RS benchmarks show that MF-RSVLM achieves state-of-the-art or highly competitive performance across remote sensing classification, image captioning, and VQA tasks.

Motivation: 现有文本引导分割方法通常将问题视为一次性定位，模型在单次前向传播中预测像素提示来驱动外部分割器。这种方法在初始定位错误时缺乏验证、重新聚焦和细化的能力，限制了分割性能。

Method: 提出RSAgent智能体，通过多轮工具调用交替进行推理和行动：查询分割工具箱、观察视觉反馈、利用历史观察修正空间假设来重新定位目标并迭代细化掩码。构建数据管道合成多轮推理分割轨迹，采用两阶段训练框架：冷启动监督微调 + 基于细粒度任务特定奖励的智能体强化学习。

Conclusion: RSAgent通过多轮推理-行动交替的智能体方法，有效解决了传统一次性定位方法的局限性，实现了更准确、可验证和可细化的文本引导对象分割，在多个基准测试中取得了显著性能提升。

Abstract: Text-guided object segmentation requires both cross-modal reasoning and pixel grounding abilities. Most recent methods treat text-guided segmentation as one-shot grounding, where the model predicts pixel prompts in a single forward pass to drive an external segmentor, which limits verification, refocusing and refinement when initial localization is wrong. To address this limitation, we propose RSAgent, an agentic Multimodal Large Language Model (MLLM) which interleaves reasoning and action for segmentation via multi-turn tool invocations. RSAgent queries a segmentation toolbox, observes visual feedback, and revises its spatial hypothesis using historical observations to re-localize targets and iteratively refine masks. We further build a data pipeline to synthesize multi-turn reasoning segmentation trajectories, and train RSAgent with a two-stage framework: cold-start supervised fine-tuning followed by agentic reinforcement learning with fine-grained, task-specific rewards. Extensive experiments show that RSAgent achieves a zero-shot performance of 66.5% gIoU on ReasonSeg test, improving over Seg-Zero-7B by 9%, and reaches 81.5% cIoU on RefCOCOg, demonstrating state-of-the-art performance on both in-domain and out-of-domain benchmarks.

Abstract: Image denoising is an important problem in low-level vision and serves as a critical module for many image recovery tasks. Anisotropic diffusion is a wide family of image denoising approaches with promising performance. However, traditional anisotropic diffusion approaches use explicit diffusion operators which are not well adapted to complex image structures. As a result, their performance is limited compared to recent learning-based approaches. In this work, we describe a trainable anisotropic diffusion framework based on reinforcement learning. By modeling the denoising process as a series of naive diffusion actions with order learned by deep Q-learning, we propose an effective diffusion-based image denoiser. The diffusion actions selected by deep Q-learning at different iterations indeed composite a stochastic anisotropic diffusion process with strong adaptivity to different image structures, which enjoys improvement over the traditional ones. The proposed denoiser is applied to removing three types of often-seen noise. The experiments show that it outperforms existing diffusion-based methods and competes with the representative deep CNN-based methods.

Abstract: In recent years, Cross-Modal Retrieval (CMR) has made significant progress in the field of multi-modal analysis. However, since it is time-consuming and labor-intensive to collect large-scale and well-annotated data, the annotation of multi-modal data inevitably contains some noise. This will degrade the retrieval performance of the model. To tackle the problem, numerous robust CMR methods have been developed, including robust learning paradigms, label calibration strategies, and instance selection mechanisms. Unfortunately, they often fail to simultaneously satisfy model performance ceilings, calibration reliability, and data utilization rate. To overcome the limitations, we propose a novel robust cross-modal learning framework, namely Neighbor-aware Instance Refining with Noisy Labels (NIRNL). Specifically, we first propose Cross-modal Margin Preserving (CMP) to adjust the relative distance between positive and negative pairs, thereby enhancing the discrimination between sample pairs. Then, we propose Neighbor-aware Instance Refining (NIR) to identify pure subset, hard subset, and noisy subset through cross-modal neighborhood consensus. Afterward, we construct different tailored optimization strategies for this fine-grained partitioning, thereby maximizing the utilization of all available data while mitigating error propagation. Extensive experiments on three benchmark datasets demonstrate that NIRNL achieves state-of-the-art performance, exhibiting remarkable robustness, especially under high noise rates.

Abstract: Fine-grained remote sensing datasets often use hierarchical label structures to differentiate objects in a coarse-to-fine manner, with each object annotated across multiple levels. However, embedding this semantic hierarchy into the representation learning space to improve fine-grained detection performance remains challenging. Previous studies have applied supervised contrastive learning at different hierarchical levels to group objects under the same parent class while distinguishing sibling subcategories. Nevertheless, they overlook two critical issues: (1) imbalanced data distribution across the label hierarchy causes high-frequency classes to dominate the learning process, and (2) learning semantic relationships among categories interferes with class-agnostic localization. To address these issues, we propose a balanced hierarchical contrastive loss combined with a decoupled learning strategy within the detection transformer (DETR) framework. The proposed loss introduces learnable class prototypes and equilibrates gradients contributed by different classes at each hierarchical level, ensuring that each hierarchical class contributes equally to the loss computation in every mini-batch. The decoupled strategy separates DETR's object queries into classification and localization sets, enabling task-specific feature extraction and optimization. Experiments on three fine-grained datasets with hierarchical annotations demonstrate that our method outperforms state-of-the-art approaches.

Motivation: 扩散Transformer模型在视频和图像生成任务中因注意力机制导致极高的计算成本，限制了实际应用。现有稀疏注意力方法存在两个关键局限：稀疏模式预测的开销和缺乏硬件通用性（主要针对GPU设计）。随着ASIC等多样化硬件平台的应用，需要一种硬件高效的稀疏注意力方案。

Abstract: In video and image generation tasks, Diffusion Transformer (DiT) models incur extremely high computational costs due to attention mechanisms, which limits their practical applications. Furthermore, with hardware advancements, a wide range of devices besides graphics processing unit (GPU), such as application-specific integrated circuit (ASIC), have been increasingly adopted for model inference. Sparse attention, which leverages the inherent sparsity of attention by skipping computations for insignificant tokens, is an effective approach to mitigate computational costs. However, existing sparse attention methods have two critical limitations: the overhead of sparse pattern prediction and the lack of hardware generality, as most of these methods are designed for GPU. To address these challenges, this study proposes RainFusion2.0, which aims to develop an online adaptive, hardware-efficient, and low-overhead sparse attention mechanism to accelerate both video and image generative models, with robust performance across diverse hardware platforms. Key technical insights include: (1) leveraging block-wise mean values as representative tokens for sparse mask prediction; (2) implementing spatiotemporal-aware token permutation; and (3) introducing a first-frame sink mechanism specifically designed for video generation scenarios. Experimental results demonstrate that RainFusion2.0 can achieve 80% sparsity while achieving an end-to-end speedup of 1.5~1.8x without compromising video quality. Moreover, RainFusion2.0 demonstrates effectiveness across various generative models and validates its generalization across diverse hardware platforms.

Abstract: Recent video-language models have shown great potential for video understanding, but still struggle with accurate temporal grounding for event-level perception. We observe that two main factors in video understanding (i.e., temporal grounding and textual response) form a logical hierarchy: accurate temporal evidence grounding lays the foundation for reliable textual response. However, existing works typically handle these two tasks in a coupled manner without a clear logical structure, leading to sub-optimal objectives. We address this from a factorized learning perspective. We first propose D$^2$VLM, a framework that decouples the learning of these two tasks while also emphasizing their inherent dependency. We adopt a "grounding then answering with evidence referencing" paradigm and introduce evidence tokens for evidence grounding, which emphasize event-level visual semantic capture beyond the focus on timestamp representation in existing works. To further facilitate the learning of these two tasks, we introduce a novel factorized preference optimization (FPO) algorithm. Unlike standard preference optimization, FPO explicitly incorporates probabilistic temporal grounding modeling into the optimization objective, enabling preference learning for both temporal grounding and textual response. We also construct a synthetic dataset to address the lack of suitable datasets for factorized preference learning with explicit temporal grounding. Experiments on various tasks demonstrate the clear advantage of our approach. Our source code is available at https://github.com/nusnlp/d2vlm.

Abstract: Current state-of-the-art paradigms predominantly treat Text-to-Motion (T2M) generation as a direct translation problem, mapping symbolic language directly to continuous poses. While effective for simple actions, this System 1 approach faces a fundamental theoretical bottleneck we identify as the Semantic-Kinematic Impedance Mismatch: the inherent difficulty of grounding semantically dense, discrete linguistic intent into kinematically dense, high-frequency motion data in a single shot. In this paper, we argue that the solution lies in an architectural shift towards Latent System 2 Reasoning. Drawing inspiration from Hierarchical Motor Control in cognitive science, we propose Latent Motion Reasoning (LMR) that reformulates generation as a two-stage Think-then-Act decision process. Central to LMR is a novel Dual-Granularity Tokenizer that disentangles motion into two distinct manifolds: a compressed, semantically rich Reasoning Latent for planning global topology, and a high-frequency Execution Latent for preserving physical fidelity. By forcing the model to autoregressively reason (plan the coarse trajectory) before it moves (instantiates the frames), we effectively bridge the ineffability gap between language and physics. We demonstrate LMR's versatility by implementing it for two representative baselines: T2M-GPT (discrete) and MotionStreamer (continuous). Extensive experiments show that LMR yields non-trivial improvements in both semantic alignment and physical plausibility, validating that the optimal substrate for motion planning is not natural language, but a learned, motion-aligned concept space.

Abstract: Monocular Depth Estimation (MDE) serves as a core perception module in autonomous driving systems, but it remains highly susceptible to adversarial attacks. Errors in depth estimation may propagate through downstream decision making and influence overall traffic safety. Existing physical attacks primarily rely on texture-based patches, which impose strict placement constraints and exhibit limited realism, thereby reducing their effectiveness in complex driving environments. To overcome these limitations, this work introduces a training-free generative adversarial attack framework that generates naturalistic, scene-consistent adversarial objects via a diffusion-based conditional generation process. The framework incorporates a Salient Region Selection module that identifies regions most influential to MDE and a Jacobian Vector Product Guidance mechanism that steers adversarial gradients toward update directions supported by the pre-trained diffusion model. This formulation enables the generation of physically plausible adversarial objects capable of inducing substantial adversarial depth shifts. Extensive digital and physical experiments demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms existing attacks in effectiveness, stealthiness, and physical deployability, underscoring its strong practical implications for autonomous driving safety assessment.

TL;DR: GeoBench是一个几何推理分层基准，包含四个推理层级，通过六个形式化验证任务评估视觉语言模型在几何问题解决中的能力，发现推理模型性能随任务复杂度增加而显著下降。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前视觉语言模型在几何推理评估中存在三个主要问题：1) 基于教科书的基准存在测试数据污染风险；2) 过度强调最终答案而忽视推理过程；3) 诊断粒度不足。需要更系统、分层的评估框架来全面评估几何问题解决能力。

Method: 提出GeoBench分层基准，包含四个推理层级：视觉感知、目标导向规划、严谨定理应用、自我反思回溯。通过TrustGeoGen生成六个形式化验证任务，系统评估从属性提取到逻辑错误校正的能力。实验对比推理模型（如OpenAI-o3）与通用多模态大语言模型。

Result: 实验显示：1) 推理模型优于通用MLLMs，但性能随任务复杂度增加显著下降；2) 子目标分解和无关前提过滤对最终解题准确率有重要影响；3) 思维链提示在某些任务中意外降低性能；4) 模型在视觉感知和定理应用层面表现相对较好，但在规划和回溯层面较弱。

Conclusion: GeoBench为几何问题解决提供了全面的评估基准，揭示了当前模型在复杂几何推理中的局限性，并为开发几何问题解决系统提供了可操作的指导方针，特别是强调了子目标分解和前提过滤的重要性。

Abstract: Geometric problem solving constitutes a critical branch of mathematical reasoning, requiring precise analysis of shapes and spatial relationships. Current evaluations of geometric reasoning in vision-language models (VLMs) face limitations, including the risk of test data contamination from textbook-based benchmarks, overemphasis on final answers over reasoning processes, and insufficient diagnostic granularity. To address these issues, we present GeoBench, a hierarchical benchmark featuring four reasoning levels in geometric problem-solving: Visual Perception, Goal-Oriented Planning, Rigorous Theorem Application, and Self-Reflective Backtracking. Through six formally verified tasks generated via TrustGeoGen, we systematically assess capabilities ranging from attribute extraction to logical error correction. Experiments reveal that while reasoning models like OpenAI-o3 outperform general MLLMs, performance declines significantly with increasing task complexity. Key findings demonstrate that sub-goal decomposition and irrelevant premise filtering critically influence final problem-solving accuracy, whereas Chain-of-Thought prompting unexpectedly degrades performance in some tasks. These findings establish GeoBench as a comprehensive benchmark while offering actionable guidelines for developing geometric problem-solving systems.

TL;DR: 提出D²-Align框架解决文本到图像扩散模型在人类反馈强化学习中出现的偏好模式崩溃问题，通过方向性解耦奖励信号来保持生成多样性


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于人类反馈强化学习的文本到图像扩散模型对齐方法虽然能在自动化奖励指标上获得高分，但会导致偏好模式崩溃（PMC）——模型收敛到狭窄的高分输出（如单一风格或普遍过曝），严重降低生成多样性

Method: 提出方向性解耦对齐（D²-Align）框架：1）在冻结的奖励模型嵌入空间中学习方向性校正；2）在优化过程中将校正应用于奖励信号，防止模型崩溃到特定模式；同时提出DivGenBench基准来量化PMC现象

Result: 综合评估显示D²-Align在质量和多样性指标上都优于现有方法，实现了更好的人类偏好对齐，同时避免了偏好模式崩溃

Conclusion: 偏好模式崩溃是由奖励模型固有偏见过度优化驱动的，D²-Align通过方向性校正奖励信号有效缓解了这一问题，在保持生成多样性的同时实现了更好的人类偏好对齐

Abstract: Recent studies have demonstrated significant progress in aligning text-to-image diffusion models with human preference via Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback. However, while existing methods achieve high scores on automated reward metrics, they often lead to Preference Mode Collapse (PMC)-a specific form of reward hacking where models converge on narrow, high-scoring outputs (e.g., images with monolithic styles or pervasive overexposure), severely degrading generative diversity. In this work, we introduce and quantify this phenomenon, proposing DivGenBench, a novel benchmark designed to measure the extent of PMC. We posit that this collapse is driven by over-optimization along the reward model's inherent biases. Building on this analysis, we propose Directional Decoupling Alignment (D$^2$-Align), a novel framework that mitigates PMC by directionally correcting the reward signal. Specifically, our method first learns a directional correction within the reward model's embedding space while keeping the model frozen. This correction is then applied to the reward signal during the optimization process, preventing the model from collapsing into specific modes and thereby maintaining diversity. Our comprehensive evaluation, combining qualitative analysis with quantitative metrics for both quality and diversity, reveals that D$^2$-Align achieves superior alignment with human preference.

Abstract: We present IMDD-1M, the first large-scale Industrial Multimodal Defect Dataset comprising 1,000,000 aligned image-text pairs, designed to advance multimodal learning for manufacturing and quality inspection. IMDD-1M contains high-resolution real-world defects spanning over 60 material categories and more than 400 defect types, each accompanied by expert-verified annotations and fine-grained textual descriptions detailing defect location, severity, and contextual attributes. This dataset enables a wide spectrum of applications, including classification, segmentation, retrieval, captioning, and generative modeling. Building upon IMDD-1M, we train a diffusion-based vision-language foundation model from scratch, specifically tailored for industrial scenarios. The model serves as a generalizable foundation that can be efficiently adapted to specialized domains through lightweight fine-tuning. With less than 5% of the task-specific data required by dedicated expert models, it achieves comparable performance, highlighting the potential of data-efficient foundation model adaptation for industrial inspection and generation, paving the way for scalable, domain-adaptive, and knowledge-grounded manufacturing intelligence.

TL;DR: DiffThinker：一种基于扩散的生成式多模态推理框架，将多模态推理重新定义为原生图像到图像的生成任务，在视觉中心任务中实现了卓越的逻辑一致性和空间精度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前多模态大语言模型（MLLMs）在多模态推理方面取得显著进展，但其推理过程仍以文本为中心，导致在复杂长视野、视觉中心任务中表现不佳。

Method: 提出生成式多模态推理范式，引入DiffThinker——一个基于扩散的推理框架。该框架将多模态推理重新定义为原生图像到图像的生成任务。

Result: 在四个领域（顺序规划、组合优化、约束满足、空间配置）的广泛实验表明，DiffThinker显著优于领先的闭源模型（GPT-5 +314.2%、Gemini-3-Flash +111.6%）和微调的Qwen3-VL-32B基线（+39.0%）。

Conclusion: 生成式多模态推理是视觉中心推理的有前景方法，DiffThinker展示了该范式的四个核心特性：效率、可控性、原生并行性和协作性。

Abstract: While recent Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have attained significant strides in multimodal reasoning, their reasoning processes remain predominantly text-centric, leading to suboptimal performance in complex long-horizon, vision-centric tasks. In this paper, we establish a novel Generative Multimodal Reasoning paradigm and introduce DiffThinker, a diffusion-based reasoning framework. Conceptually, DiffThinker reformulates multimodal reasoning as a native generative image-to-image task, achieving superior logical consistency and spatial precision in vision-centric tasks. We perform a systematic comparison between DiffThinker and MLLMs, providing the first in-depth investigation into the intrinsic characteristics of this paradigm, revealing four core properties: efficiency, controllability, native parallelism, and collaboration. Extensive experiments across four domains (sequential planning, combinatorial optimization, constraint satisfaction, and spatial configuration) demonstrate that DiffThinker significantly outperforms leading closed source models including GPT-5 (+314.2\%) and Gemini-3-Flash (+111.6\%), as well as the fine-tuned Qwen3-VL-32B baseline (+39.0\%), highlighting generative multimodal reasoning as a promising approach for vision-centric reasoning.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出Deep Global Clustering (DGC)框架，通过局部补丁学习全局聚类结构，实现内存高效的高光谱图像分割，无需预训练，在消费级硬件上30分钟内完成训练，但存在多目标损失平衡导致的优化不稳定问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 高光谱图像分析面临数据量大、内存不足的计算瓶颈。现有基于大规模遥感数据集预训练的基础模型难以迁移到近距离农业监测等特定领域应用，因为光谱特征、空间尺度和语义目标存在根本差异。

Method: 提出Deep Global Clustering (DGC)概念框架：通过重叠区域的局部补丁操作学习全局聚类结构，无需预训练。使用小补丁处理并强制一致性，保持恒定内存使用。框架支持可导航的语义粒度，实现从背景-组织分离到疾病检测的多层次分析。

Result: 在叶片疾病数据集上，DGC实现背景-组织分离（平均IoU 0.925），并通过可导航语义粒度展示无监督疾病检测能力。训练时间小于30分钟（消费级硬件），内存使用恒定。但存在优化不稳定问题，源于多目标损失平衡，导致特征空间聚类过度合并。

Conclusion: DGC作为概念框架具有设计价值，但稳定实现需要动态损失平衡的原则性方法。该工作定位为"智力脚手架"，设计理念有优点，但实际应用需要解决优化稳定性问题。代码和数据已开源。

Abstract: Hyperspectral imaging (HSI) analysis faces computational bottlenecks due to massive data volumes that exceed available memory. While foundation models pre-trained on large remote sensing datasets show promise, their learned representations often fail to transfer to domain-specific applications like close-range agricultural monitoring where spectral signatures, spatial scales, and semantic targets differ fundamentally. This report presents Deep Global Clustering (DGC), a conceptual framework for memory-efficient HSI segmentation that learns global clustering structure from local patch observations without pre-training. DGC operates on small patches with overlapping regions to enforce consistency, enabling training in under 30 minutes on consumer hardware while maintaining constant memory usage. On a leaf disease dataset, DGC achieves background-tissue separation (mean IoU 0.925) and demonstrates unsupervised disease detection through navigable semantic granularity. However, the framework suffers from optimization instability rooted in multi-objective loss balancing: meaningful representations emerge rapidly but degrade due to cluster over-merging in feature space. We position this work as intellectual scaffolding - the design philosophy has merit, but stable implementation requires principled approaches to dynamic loss balancing. Code and data are available at https://github.com/b05611038/HSI_global_clustering.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 扩散模型难以覆盖低概率区域，标准CFG会导致样本过简化或失真，而基于坏版本引导的方法需要精心设计的退化策略、额外训练和采样步骤。需要一种简单有效的策略来提升生成质量。

Method: 提出Internal Guidance (IG)策略：1) 训练时在中间层添加辅助监督；2) 采样时外推中间层和深层输出以获得生成结果。该方法简单且无需额外训练或复杂采样步骤。

Result: 在ImageNet 256x256上，SiT-XL/2+IG在80和800轮分别达到FID=5.31和1.75；LightningDiT-XL/1+IG达到FID=1.34，显著超越所有方法；结合CFG后达到当前SOTA的FID=1.19。

Conclusion: IG是一种简单有效的策略，通过在训练时添加中间层监督和采样时外推输出，显著提升了扩散模型的训练效率和生成质量，在多个基准上取得了突破性成果。

Abstract: The diffusion model presents a powerful ability to capture the entire (conditional) data distribution. However, due to the lack of sufficient training and data to learn to cover low-probability areas, the model will be penalized for failing to generate high-quality images corresponding to these areas. To achieve better generation quality, guidance strategies such as classifier free guidance (CFG) can guide the samples to the high-probability areas during the sampling stage. However, the standard CFG often leads to over-simplified or distorted samples. On the other hand, the alternative line of guiding diffusion model with its bad version is limited by carefully designed degradation strategies, extra training and additional sampling steps. In this paper, we proposed a simple yet effective strategy Internal Guidance (IG), which introduces an auxiliary supervision on the intermediate layer during training process and extrapolates the intermediate and deep layer's outputs to obtain generative results during sampling process. This simple strategy yields significant improvements in both training efficiency and generation quality on various baselines. On ImageNet 256x256, SiT-XL/2+IG achieves FID=5.31 and FID=1.75 at 80 and 800 epochs. More impressively, LightningDiT-XL/1+IG achieves FID=1.34 which achieves a large margin between all of these methods. Combined with CFG, LightningDiT-XL/1+IG achieves the current state-of-the-art FID of 1.19.

Motivation: DiT模型在迭代去噪过程中存在大量跨步骤的冗余计算，导致高推理成本，需要有效的推理加速方法

Method: 提出CorGi框架：1) 基于贡献度评估识别低贡献transformer块；2) 在区间内缓存这些块并在后续步骤中重用；3) CorGi+针对文本到图像任务，利用跨注意力图识别显著token并应用部分注意力更新来保护重要对象细节

Result: 在先进的DiT模型上评估显示，CorGi和CorGi+平均实现高达2.0倍加速，同时保持高质量生成

Conclusion: CorGi和CorGi+是有效的训练无关DiT推理加速框架，通过选择性重用transformer块输出来显著减少冗余计算，在保持生成质量的同时实现显著加速

Abstract: Diffusion transformer (DiT) achieves remarkable performance in visual generation, but its iterative denoising process combined with larger capacity leads to a high inference cost. Recent works have demonstrated that the iterative denoising process of DiT models involves substantial redundant computation across steps. To effectively reduce the redundant computation in DiT, we propose CorGi (Contribution-Guided Block-Wise Interval Caching), training-free DiT inference acceleration framework that selectively reuses the outputs of transformer blocks in DiT across denoising steps. CorGi caches low-contribution blocks and reuses them in later steps within each interval to reduce redundant computation while preserving generation quality. For text-to-image tasks, we further propose CorGi+, which leverages per-block cross-attention maps to identify salient tokens and applies partial attention updates to protect important object details. Evaluation on the state-of-the-art DiT models demonstrates that CorGi and CorGi+ achieve up to 2.0x speedup on average, while preserving high generation quality.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出注意力精炼模块（ARM），一种轻量级可学习模块，通过自适应融合CLIP的层次特征来提升开放词汇语义分割性能，采用"一次训练，随处使用"范式。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有无训练方法要么依赖昂贵的外部基础模型（如SAM、DINO），要么对CLIP内部特征使用静态手工启发式方法，导致计算成本高或效果次优。CLIP的图像级表示缺乏精确的像素级细节，限制了开放词汇语义分割的性能。

Method: 提出注意力精炼模块（ARM），包含语义引导的交叉注意力块（使用鲁棒的深层特征作为K、V来选择和精炼细节丰富的浅层特征Q）和自注意力块。采用"一次训练，随处使用"范式，在通用数据集（如COCO-Stuff）上训练一次后，可作为通用即插即用后处理器用于各种无训练框架。

Result: 在多个基准测试中，ARM能持续提升基线性能，且推理开销可忽略不计，为无训练开放词汇语义分割建立了高效有效的范式。

Conclusion: ARM通过自适应融合CLIP的层次特征，有效解锁和精炼了CLIP的内部潜力，解决了现有方法的计算成本高或效果次优问题，为开放词汇语义分割提供了轻量级、高效的解决方案。

Abstract: Open-vocabulary semantic segmentation (OVSS) is fundamentally hampered by the coarse, image-level representations of CLIP, which lack precise pixel-level details. Existing training-free methods attempt to resolve this by either importing priors from costly external foundation models (e.g., SAM, DINO) or by applying static, hand-crafted heuristics to CLIP's internal features. These approaches are either computationally expensive or sub-optimal. We propose the Attention Refinement Module (ARM), a lightweight, learnable module that effectively unlocks and refines CLIP's internal potential. Unlike static-fusion methods, ARM learns to adaptively fuse hierarchical features. It employs a semantically-guided cross-attention block, using robust deep features (K, V) to select and refine detail-rich shallow features (Q), followed by a self-attention block. The key innovation lies in a ``train once, use anywhere" paradigm. Trained once on a general-purpose dataset (e.g., COCO-Stuff), ARM acts as a universal plug-and-play post-processor for diverse training-free frameworks. Extensive experiments show that ARM consistently boosts baseline performance on multiple benchmarks with negligible inference overhead, establishing an efficient and effective paradigm for training-free OVSS.

Motivation: 基于视觉的自动驾驶系统需要多样化和可扩展的训练数据，现有视频对象编辑方法在保持高视觉保真度和时间一致性方面存在困难，需要一种能够同时实现逼真和连贯编辑的解决方案。

Method: 1) 基于文本到视频扩散先验确保时间一致性；2) 将预训练2D编码器的时序无关潜在特征注入3D解码器以恢复细节；3) 引入两阶段数据对齐策略：粗粒度3D对齐和细粒度2D细化，解决场景对象与插入资产之间的分布不匹配问题。

Conclusion: Mirage通过创新的特征注入机制和对齐策略，成功解决了驾驶场景资产编辑中的时间一致性和空间保真度问题，为自动驾驶数据增强提供了有效的解决方案。

Abstract: Vision-centric autonomous driving systems rely on diverse and scalable training data to achieve robust performance. While video object editing offers a promising path for data augmentation, existing methods often struggle to maintain both high visual fidelity and temporal coherence. In this work, we propose \textbf{Mirage}, a one-step video diffusion model for photorealistic and coherent asset editing in driving scenes. Mirage builds upon a text-to-video diffusion prior to ensure temporal consistency across frames. However, 3D causal variational autoencoders often suffer from degraded spatial fidelity due to compression, and directly passing 3D encoder features to decoder layers breaks temporal causality. To address this, we inject temporally agnostic latents from a pretrained 2D encoder into the 3D decoder to restore detail while preserving causal structures. Furthermore, because scene objects and inserted assets are optimized under different objectives, their Gaussians exhibit a distribution mismatch that leads to pose misalignment. To mitigate this, we introduce a two-stage data alignment strategy combining coarse 3D alignment and fine 2D refinement, thereby improving alignment and providing cleaner supervision. Extensive experiments demonstrate that Mirage achieves high realism and temporal consistency across diverse editing scenarios. Beyond asset editing, Mirage can also generalize to other video-to-video translation tasks, serving as a reliable baseline for future research.

Motivation: RGB相机在快速运动、低光照或高动态范围条件下性能下降，而事件相机缺乏颜色和纹理信息。现有RGB-事件融合方法计算成本高且主要关注空间融合，忽略了事件流的时间动态特性。

Conclusion: MambaSeg通过并行Mamba编码器和双维度交互模块，有效融合RGB和事件数据的互补特性，在保持高性能的同时降低计算复杂度，为高效多模态感知提供了有前景的解决方案。

Abstract: Semantic segmentation is a fundamental task in computer vision with wide-ranging applications, including autonomous driving and robotics. While RGB-based methods have achieved strong performance with CNNs and Transformers, their effectiveness degrades under fast motion, low-light, or high dynamic range conditions due to limitations of frame cameras. Event cameras offer complementary advantages such as high temporal resolution and low latency, yet lack color and texture, making them insufficient on their own. To address this, recent research has explored multimodal fusion of RGB and event data; however, many existing approaches are computationally expensive and focus primarily on spatial fusion, neglecting the temporal dynamics inherent in event streams. In this work, we propose MambaSeg, a novel dual-branch semantic segmentation framework that employs parallel Mamba encoders to efficiently model RGB images and event streams. To reduce cross-modal ambiguity, we introduce the Dual-Dimensional Interaction Module (DDIM), comprising a Cross-Spatial Interaction Module (CSIM) and a Cross-Temporal Interaction Module (CTIM), which jointly perform fine-grained fusion along both spatial and temporal dimensions. This design improves cross-modal alignment, reduces ambiguity, and leverages the complementary properties of each modality. Extensive experiments on the DDD17 and DSEC datasets demonstrate that MambaSeg achieves state-of-the-art segmentation performance while significantly reducing computational cost, showcasing its promise for efficient, scalable, and robust multimodal perception.

Motivation: CBCT中的金属伪影严重阻碍诊断，现有深度学习方法存在局限：监督方法因"回归到均值"导致光谱模糊，无监督方法存在结构幻觉风险，而扩散模型虽能提供真实感但采样速度慢不适合临床使用

Method: 提出PGMP框架：1) AAPS管道通过蒙特卡洛光谱建模和患者特异性数字孪生合成高保真训练对；2) DMP-Former采用直接x预测范式，将恢复重新表述为确定性流形投影；3) SSA模块利用医学基础模型先验锚定解决方案

Conclusion: PGMP框架有效解决了CBCT金属伪影减少问题，通过物理模拟训练数据、确定性单次推理和医学先验约束，实现了临床适用的高效可靠解决方案

Abstract: Metal artifacts in Dental CBCT severely obscure anatomical structures, hindering diagnosis. Current deep learning for Metal Artifact Reduction (MAR) faces limitations: supervised methods suffer from spectral blurring due to "regression-to-the-mean", while unsupervised ones risk structural hallucinations. Denoising Diffusion Models (DDPMs) offer realism but rely on slow, stochastic iterative sampling, unsuitable for clinical use. To resolve this, we propose the Physically-Grounded Manifold Projection (PGMP) framework. First, our Anatomically-Adaptive Physics Simulation (AAPS) pipeline synthesizes high-fidelity training pairs via Monte Carlo spectral modeling and patient-specific digital twins, bridging the synthetic-to-real gap. Second, our DMP-Former adapts the Direct x-Prediction paradigm, reformulating restoration as a deterministic manifold projection to recover clean anatomy in a single forward pass, eliminating stochastic sampling. Finally, a Semantic-Structural Alignment (SSA) module anchors the solution using priors from medical foundation models (MedDINOv3), ensuring clinical plausibility. Experiments on synthetic and multi-center clinical datasets show PGMP outperforms state-of-the-art methods on unseen anatomy, setting new benchmarks in efficiency and diagnostic reliability.

TL;DR: 提出DualityForge框架，通过可控扩散视频编辑合成反事实视频数据，构建DualityVidQA数据集，结合DNA-Train训练方法，显著减少多模态大语言模型在反事实视频理解中的幻觉问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多模态大语言模型在视频理解中过度依赖语言先验，导致视觉未接地幻觉，特别是在处理违反常识的反事实视频时。由于文本与视频数据不平衡以及反事实数据收集成本高昂，这一问题难以解决。

Method: 1. DualityForge框架：使用可控扩散视频编辑将真实视频转换为反事实场景，嵌入结构化上下文信息自动生成高质量QA对和原始-编辑视频对；2. 构建DualityVidQA数据集；3. DNA-Train训练方法：两阶段SFT-RL训练，RL阶段应用成对ℓ₁优势归一化实现更稳定高效的政策优化。

Result: 在DualityVidQA-Test上，方法显著减少模型在反事实视频上的幻觉，相比Qwen2.5-VL-7B基线相对提升24.0%。在幻觉和通用基准测试中均取得显著增益，显示强泛化能力。

Conclusion: 提出的DualityForge框架和DNA-Train方法有效解决了MLLM在反事实视频理解中的幻觉问题，通过合成高质量反事实数据和对比训练策略提升了模型性能，具有良好泛化能力。

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have made remarkable progress in video understanding. However, they suffer from a critical vulnerability: an over-reliance on language priors, which can lead to visual ungrounded hallucinations, especially when processing counterfactual videos that defy common sense. This limitation, stemming from the intrinsic data imbalance between text and video, is challenging to address due to the substantial cost of collecting and annotating counterfactual data. To address this, we introduce DualityForge, a novel counterfactual data synthesis framework that employs controllable, diffusion-based video editing to transform real-world videos into counterfactual scenarios. By embedding structured contextual information into the video editing and QA generation processes, the framework automatically produces high-quality QA pairs together with original-edited video pairs for contrastive training. Based on this, we build DualityVidQA, a large-scale video dataset designed to reduce MLLM hallucinations. In addition, to fully exploit the contrastive nature of our paired data, we propose Duality-Normalized Advantage Training (DNA-Train), a two-stage SFT-RL training regime where the RL phase applies pair-wise $\ell_1$ advantage normalization, thereby enabling a more stable and efficient policy optimization. Experiments on DualityVidQA-Test demonstrate that our method substantially reduces model hallucinations on counterfactual videos, yielding a relative improvement of 24.0% over the Qwen2.5-VL-7B baseline. Moreover, our approach achieves significant gains across both hallucination and general-purpose benchmarks, indicating strong generalization capability. We will open-source our dataset and code.

TL;DR: 提出了一种空间提升的全景拼接框架，通过将图像提升到三维点表示、全局融合、统一投影中心映射到全景流形，有效解决了传统二维拼接在复杂三维场景中的几何失真和重影问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统图像拼接技术主要使用二维单应性变换和网格变形，适用于近似共面或视差较小的场景。但在真实三维场景中，由于存在多个深度层和遮挡，这些方法会导致重影、结构弯曲和拉伸失真，特别是在多视图累积和360°闭环拼接场景中问题更加严重。

Method: 1. 将输入图像提升为统一坐标系下的密集三维点表示，通过置信度指标增强全局跨视图融合；2. 在三维空间中建立统一投影中心，使用等距柱面投影将融合数据映射到单一全景流形；3. 在画布域进行空洞填充以处理视点转换揭示的未知区域，恢复连续纹理和语义一致性。

Result: 实验评估表明，该方法在显著视差和复杂遮挡场景中大幅减少了几何失真和重影伪影，产生了更自然和一致的全景结果。

Conclusion: 该框架将拼接从二维变形范式重新概念化为三维一致性范式，能够灵活集成各种三维提升和补全模块，为复杂三维场景的全景拼接提供了更有效的解决方案。

Abstract: Traditional image stitching techniques have predominantly utilized two-dimensional homography transformations and mesh warping to achieve alignment on a planar surface. While effective for scenes that are approximately coplanar or exhibit minimal parallax, these approaches often result in ghosting, structural bending, and stretching distortions in non-overlapping regions when applied to real three-dimensional scenes characterized by multiple depth layers and occlusions. Such challenges are exacerbated in multi-view accumulations and 360° closed-loop stitching scenarios. In response, this study introduces a spatially lifted panoramic stitching framework that initially elevates each input image into a dense three-dimensional point representation within a unified coordinate system, facilitating global cross-view fusion augmented by confidence metrics. Subsequently, a unified projection center is established in three-dimensional space, and an equidistant cylindrical projection is employed to map the fused data onto a single panoramic manifold, thereby producing a geometrically consistent 360° panoramic layout. Finally, hole filling is conducted within the canvas domain to address unknown regions revealed by viewpoint transitions, restoring continuous texture and semantic coherence. This framework reconceptualizes stitching from a two-dimensional warping paradigm to a three-dimensional consistency paradigm and is designed to flexibly incorporate various three-dimensional lifting and completion modules. Experimental evaluations demonstrate that the proposed method substantially mitigates geometric distortions and ghosting artifacts in scenarios involving significant parallax and complex occlusions, yielding panoramic results that are more natural and consistent.

TL;DR: UniAct是一个两阶段框架，通过微调MLLM和因果流式处理管道，实现人形机器人以低于500毫秒的延迟执行多模态指令，在零样本跟踪不完美参考运动方面提升了19%的成功率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 人形机器人领域长期目标是实现能够遵循多样化多模态指令的通用智能体。现有方法在将语言、音乐、轨迹等异构指令转换为稳定实时动作方面存在瓶颈，需要弥合高级多模态感知与全身执行之间的鸿沟。

Method: 提出UniAct两阶段框架：1) 集成微调的多模态大语言模型(MLLM)用于高级指令理解；2) 因果流式处理管道用于实时动作生成。通过FSQ共享离散码本统一输入，确保跨模态对齐并将运动约束在物理可行的流形上。

Conclusion: UniAct标志着向响应式通用人形助手迈出了关键一步，通过统一感知和控制实现了无缝交互，为人形机器人执行多样化多模态指令提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: A long-standing objective in humanoid robotics is the realization of versatile agents capable of following diverse multimodal instructions with human-level flexibility. Despite advances in humanoid control, bridging high-level multimodal perception with whole-body execution remains a significant bottleneck. Existing methods often struggle to translate heterogeneous instructions -- such as language, music, and trajectories -- into stable, real-time actions. Here we show that UniAct, a two-stage framework integrating a fine-tuned MLLM with a causal streaming pipeline, enables humanoid robots to execute multimodal instructions with sub-500 ms latency. By unifying inputs through a shared discrete codebook via FSQ, UniAct ensures cross-modal alignment while constraining motions to a physically grounded manifold. This approach yields a 19% improvement in the success rate of zero-shot tracking of imperfect reference motions. We validate UniAct on UniMoCap, our 20-hour humanoid motion benchmark, demonstrating robust generalization across diverse real-world scenarios. Our results mark a critical step toward responsive, general-purpose humanoid assistants capable of seamless interaction through unified perception and control.

TL;DR: CERES是一个因果推理框架，通过双模态因果干预解决Ego-RVOS任务中的语言表示偏见和视觉混淆问题，在基准测试中达到最先进性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Ego-RVOS任务在分割第一人称视频中与人类动作相关的特定对象时面临挑战，现有方法容易受到训练数据中偏斜的对象-动作配对和第一人称视角固有视觉混淆因素（如快速运动和频繁遮挡）的影响，导致学习到虚假相关性。

Method: CERES是一个插件式因果框架，采用双模态因果干预：1）应用后门调整原则对抗从数据集统计中学习的语言表示偏见；2）利用前门调整概念，通过因果原则指导将语义视觉特征与几何深度信息智能集成，解决视觉混淆问题，创建对第一人称失真更鲁棒的表征。

Result: 大量实验表明，CERES在Ego-RVOS基准测试中实现了最先进的性能，证明了因果推理在构建更可靠的广泛第一人称视频理解模型方面的潜力。

Conclusion: CERES通过因果推理框架有效解决了Ego-RVOS任务中的语言偏见和视觉混淆问题，为更广泛的第一人称视频理解提供了更可靠的建模方法。

Abstract: Egocentric Referring Video Object Segmentation (Ego-RVOS) aims to segment the specific object actively involved in a human action, as described by a language query, within first-person videos. This task is critical for understanding egocentric human behavior. However, achieving such segmentation robustly is challenging due to ambiguities inherent in egocentric videos and biases present in training data. Consequently, existing methods often struggle, learning spurious correlations from skewed object-action pairings in datasets and fundamental visual confounding factors of the egocentric perspective, such as rapid motion and frequent occlusions. To address these limitations, we introduce Causal Ego-REferring Segmentation (CERES), a plug-in causal framework that adapts strong, pre-trained RVOS backbones to the egocentric domain. CERES implements dual-modal causal intervention: applying backdoor adjustment principles to counteract language representation biases learned from dataset statistics, and leveraging front-door adjustment concepts to address visual confounding by intelligently integrating semantic visual features with geometric depth information guided by causal principles, creating representations more robust to egocentric distortions. Extensive experiments demonstrate that CERES achieves state-of-the-art performance on Ego-RVOS benchmarks, highlighting the potential of applying causal reasoning to build more reliable models for broader egocentric video understanding.

TL;DR: SenseNova-MARS是一个多模态智能体推理与搜索框架，通过强化学习赋予视觉语言模型交错的视觉推理和工具使用能力，在知识密集型视觉任务中实现动态工具集成和连续推理。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视觉语言模型主要局限于文本导向的思维链或孤立工具调用，缺乏人类般的动态工具操作与连续推理交错能力，特别是在需要协调外部工具（如搜索和图像裁剪）的知识密集型和视觉复杂场景中。

Method: 提出SenseNova-MARS多模态智能体推理与搜索框架，通过强化学习实现交错的视觉推理和工具使用能力。具体包括：动态集成图像搜索、文本搜索和图像裁剪工具；提出批量归一化组序列策略优化（BN-GSPO）算法提高训练稳定性；引入HR-MMSearch基准测试（首个由高分辨率图像组成的搜索导向基准）。

Result: SenseNova-MARS在开源搜索和细粒度图像理解基准上达到最先进性能。在搜索导向基准上，SenseNova-MARS-8B在MMSearch上得分67.84，在HR-MMSearch上得分41.64，超越Gemini-3-Flash和GPT-5等专有模型。

Conclusion: SenseNova-MARS通过提供有效且鲁棒的工具使用能力，代表了向智能体视觉语言模型发展的有前景的一步。所有代码、模型和数据集将被公开以促进该领域进一步研究。

Abstract: While Vision-Language Models (VLMs) can solve complex tasks through agentic reasoning, their capabilities remain largely constrained to text-oriented chain-of-thought or isolated tool invocation. They fail to exhibit the human-like proficiency required to seamlessly interleave dynamic tool manipulation with continuous reasoning, particularly in knowledge-intensive and visually complex scenarios that demand coordinated external tools such as search and image cropping. In this work, we introduce SenseNova-MARS, a novel Multimodal Agentic Reasoning and Search framework that empowers VLMs with interleaved visual reasoning and tool-use capabilities via reinforcement learning (RL). Specifically, SenseNova-MARS dynamically integrates the image search, text search, and image crop tools to tackle fine-grained and knowledge-intensive visual understanding challenges. In the RL stage, we propose the Batch-Normalized Group Sequence Policy Optimization (BN-GSPO) algorithm to improve the training stability and advance the model's ability to invoke tools and reason effectively. To comprehensively evaluate the agentic VLMs on complex visual tasks, we introduce the HR-MMSearch benchmark, the first search-oriented benchmark composed of high-resolution images with knowledge-intensive and search-driven questions. Experiments demonstrate that SenseNova-MARS achieves state-of-the-art performance on open-source search and fine-grained image understanding benchmarks. Specifically, on search-oriented benchmarks, SenseNova-MARS-8B scores 67.84 on MMSearch and 41.64 on HR-MMSearch, surpassing proprietary models such as Gemini-3-Flash and GPT-5. SenseNova-MARS represents a promising step toward agentic VLMs by providing effective and robust tool-use capabilities. To facilitate further research in this field, we will release all code, models, and datasets.

TL;DR: LVLDrive是一个将LiDAR点云作为额外输入模态的框架，旨在增强现有视觉语言模型在自动驾驶中的3D度量空间理解能力，通过渐进融合机制解决3D数据对预训练模型的干扰问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前基于视觉语言模型的自动驾驶方法主要依赖2D图像线索，在复杂场景理解和决策中存在度量空间推理和几何推断不准确的问题，这影响了驾驶策略的安全性和可靠性。

Method: 提出LVLDrive框架，将LiDAR点云作为额外输入模态；设计渐进融合Q-Former逐步注入LiDAR特征，保护预训练VLM的知识基础；构建空间感知问答数据集来显式教授模型3D感知和推理能力。

Result: 在驾驶基准测试上的广泛实验表明，LVLDrive在场景理解、度量空间感知和可靠驾驶决策方面优于仅使用视觉的对比方法。

Conclusion: 研究表明，显式的3D度量数据对于构建可信赖的基于VLM的自动驾驶系统是必要的，LVLDrive通过融合LiDAR点云有效提升了VLM的3D空间理解能力。

Abstract: While Vision-Language Models (VLMs) show significant promise for end-to-end autonomous driving by leveraging the common sense embedded in language models, their reliance on 2D image cues for complex scene understanding and decision-making presents a critical bottleneck for safety and reliability. Current image-based methods struggle with accurate metric spatial reasoning and geometric inference, leading to unreliable driving policies. To bridge this gap, we propose LVLDrive (LiDAR-Vision-Language), a novel framework specifically designed to upgrade existing VLMs with robust 3D metric spatial understanding for autonomous driving by incoperating LiDAR point cloud as an extra input modality. A key challenge lies in mitigating the catastrophic disturbance introduced by disparate 3D data to the pre-trained VLMs. To this end, we introduce a Gradual Fusion Q-Former that incrementally injects LiDAR features, ensuring the stability and preservation of the VLM's existing knowledge base. Furthermore, we develop a spatial-aware question-answering (SA-QA) dataset to explicitly teach the model advanced 3D perception and reasoning capabilities. Extensive experiments on driving benchmarks demonstrate that LVLDrive achieves superior performance compared to vision-only counterparts across scene understanding, metric spatial perception, and reliable driving decision-making. Our work highlights the necessity of explicit 3D metric data for building trustworthy VLM-based autonomous systems.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有皮肤病图像分析数据集主要关注皮肤镜图像，缺乏患者自述查询和临床上下文，限制了其在以患者为中心的护理中的应用。需要填补这一空白，支持更全面的皮肤病分析任务。

Method: 引入皮肤病评估框架DAS，包含36个高级和27个细粒度评估问题，提供英文和中文多选项。基于DAS提供专家标注的封闭式问答和分割数据集，评估多模态模型性能。分割任务评估多种提示策略，问答任务测试多个先进模型。

Conclusion: DermaVQA-DAS填补了皮肤病图像分析中患者中心数据的空白，DAS框架提供了标准化临床特征评估方法。研究展示了多模态模型在皮肤病分析任务中的潜力，公开数据集和评估协议将加速患者中心皮肤病视觉语言建模研究。

Abstract: Recent advances in dermatological image analysis have been driven by large-scale annotated datasets; however, most existing benchmarks focus on dermatoscopic images and lack patient-authored queries and clinical context, limiting their applicability to patient-centered care. To address this gap, we introduce DermaVQA-DAS, an extension of the DermaVQA dataset that supports two complementary tasks: closed-ended question answering (QA) and dermatological lesion segmentation. Central to this work is the Dermatology Assessment Schema (DAS), a novel expert-developed framework that systematically captures clinically meaningful dermatological features in a structured and standardized form. DAS comprises 36 high-level and 27 fine-grained assessment questions, with multiple-choice options in English and Chinese. Leveraging DAS, we provide expert-annotated datasets for both closed QA and segmentation and benchmark state-of-the-art multimodal models. For segmentation, we evaluate multiple prompting strategies and show that prompt design impacts performance: the default prompt achieves the best results under Mean-of-Max and Mean-of-Mean evaluation aggregation schemes, while an augmented prompt incorporating both patient query title and content yields the highest performance under majority-vote-based microscore evaluation, achieving a Jaccard index of 0.395 and a Dice score of 0.566 with BiomedParse. For closed-ended QA, overall performance is strong across models, with average accuracies ranging from 0.729 to 0.798; o3 achieves the best overall accuracy (0.798), closely followed by GPT-4.1 (0.796), while Gemini-1.5-Pro shows competitive performance within the Gemini family (0.783). We publicly release DermaVQA-DAS, the DAS schema, and evaluation protocols to support and accelerate future research in patient-centered dermatological vision-language modeling (https://osf.io/72rp3).

Abstract: The rapid advancement of autonomous systems, including self-driving vehicles and drones, has intensified the need to forge true Spatial Intelligence from multi-modal onboard sensor data. While foundation models excel in single-modal contexts, integrating their capabilities across diverse sensors like cameras and LiDAR to create a unified understanding remains a formidable challenge. This paper presents a comprehensive framework for multi-modal pre-training, identifying the core set of techniques driving progress toward this goal. We dissect the interplay between foundational sensor characteristics and learning strategies, evaluating the role of platform-specific datasets in enabling these advancements. Our central contribution is the formulation of a unified taxonomy for pre-training paradigms: ranging from single-modality baselines to sophisticated unified frameworks that learn holistic representations for advanced tasks like 3D object detection and semantic occupancy prediction. Furthermore, we investigate the integration of textual inputs and occupancy representations to facilitate open-world perception and planning. Finally, we identify critical bottlenecks, such as computational efficiency and model scalability, and propose a roadmap toward general-purpose multi-modal foundation models capable of achieving robust Spatial Intelligence for real-world deployment.

Motivation: 大规模摄像头舰队上的实时视频分析计算成本高昂，现有的动态模型大小选择方法存在采样效率低和精度预测不准确的问题，特别是在移动视频和低精度目标场景下表现不佳

Method: RedunCut采用测量驱动的规划器来估计采样的成本效益权衡，并使用轻量级数据驱动的性能模型来改进精度预测，解决了现有方法采样成本过高和精度预测不准确的问题

Conclusion: RedunCut通过改进的采样策略和精度预测模型，成功解决了动态模型大小选择中的关键问题，为大规模实时视频分析提供了高效且鲁棒的解决方案

Abstract: Live video analytics (LVA) runs continuously across massive camera fleets, but inference cost with modern vision models remains high. To address this, dynamic model size selection (DMSS) is an attractive approach: it is content-aware but treats models as black boxes, and could potentially reduce cost by up to 10x without model retraining or modification. Without ground truth labels at runtime, we observe that DMSS methods use two stages per segment: (i) sampling a few models to calculate prediction statistics (e.g., confidences), then (ii) selection of the model size from those statistics. Prior systems fail to generalize to diverse workloads, particularly to mobile videos and lower accuracy targets. We identify that the failure modes stem from inefficient sampling whose cost exceeds its benefit, and inaccurate per-segment accuracy prediction.
  In this work, we present RedunCut, a new DMSS system that addresses both: It uses a measurement-driven planner that estimates the cost-benefit tradeoff of sampling, and a lightweight, data-driven performance model to improve accuracy prediction. Across road-vehicle, drone, and surveillance videos and multiple model families and tasks, RedunCut reduces compute cost by 14-62% at fixed accuracy and remains robust to limited historical data and to drift.

Result: DyStream每帧生成时间仅34毫秒，确保整个系统延迟低于100毫秒；在HDTF数据集上获得离线8.13和在线7.61的LipSync Confidence分数，达到最先进的唇形同步质量。

Conclusion: DyStream通过流匹配自回归框架和因果编码器增强设计，成功解决了实时双人对话头部视频生成的延迟问题，在保持低延迟的同时实现了高质量的唇形同步效果。

Abstract: Generating realistic, dyadic talking head video requires ultra-low latency. Existing chunk-based methods require full non-causal context windows, introducing significant delays. This high latency critically prevents the immediate, non-verbal feedback required for a realistic listener. To address this, we present DyStream, a flow matching-based autoregressive model that could generate video in real-time from both speaker and listener audio. Our method contains two key designs: (1) we adopt a stream-friendly autoregressive framework with flow-matching heads for probabilistic modeling, and (2) We propose a causal encoder enhanced by a lookahead module to incorporate short future context (e.g., 60 ms) to improve quality while maintaining low latency. Our analysis shows this simple-and-effective method significantly surpass alternative causal strategies, including distillation and generative encoder. Extensive experiments show that DyStream could generate video within 34 ms per frame, guaranteeing the entire system latency remains under 100 ms. Besides, it achieves state-of-the-art lip-sync quality, with offline and online LipSync Confidence scores of 8.13 and 7.61 on HDTF, respectively. The model, weights and codes are available.

Conclusion: 该系统能够提供客观、一致且可解释的反馈，有望实现更标准化、数据驱动的手术教育和评估，解决传统方法的局限性

Abstract: The development of effective training and evaluation strategies is critical. Conventional methods for assessing surgical proficiency typically rely on expert supervision, either through onsite observation or retrospective analysis of recorded procedures. However, these approaches are inherently subjective, susceptible to inter-rater variability, and require substantial time and effort from expert surgeons. These demands are often impractical in low- and middle-income countries, thereby limiting the scalability and consistency of such methods across training programs. To address these limitations, we propose a novel AI-driven framework for the automated assessment of microanastomosis performance. The system integrates a video transformer architecture based on TimeSformer, improved with hierarchical temporal attention and weighted spatial attention mechanisms, to achieve accurate action recognition within surgical videos. Fine-grained motion features are then extracted using a YOLO-based object detection and tracking method, allowing for detailed analysis of instrument kinematics. Performance is evaluated along five aspects of microanastomosis skill, including overall action execution, motion quality during procedure-critical actions, and general instrument handling. Experimental validation using a dataset of 58 expert-annotated videos demonstrates the effectiveness of the system, achieving 87.7% frame-level accuracy in action segmentation that increased to 93.62% with post-processing, and an average classification accuracy of 76% in replicating expert assessments across all skill aspects. These findings highlight the system's potential to provide objective, consistent, and interpretable feedback, thereby enabling more standardized, data-driven training and evaluation in surgical education.

Abstract: While insights into the workings of the transformer model have largely emerged by analysing their behaviour on language tasks, this work investigates the representations learnt by the Vision Transformer (ViT) encoder through the lens of compositionality. We introduce a framework, analogous to prior work on measuring compositionality in representation learning, to test for compositionality in the ViT encoder. Crucial to drawing this analogy is the Discrete Wavelet Transform (DWT), which is a simple yet effective tool for obtaining input-dependent primitives in the vision setting. By examining the ability of composed representations to reproduce original image representations, we empirically test the extent to which compositionality is respected in the representation space. Our findings show that primitives from a one-level DWT decomposition produce encoder representations that approximately compose in latent space, offering a new perspective on how ViTs structure information.

Abstract: High-fidelity compression of multispectral solar imagery remains challenging for space missions, where limited bandwidth must be balanced against preserving fine spectral and spatial details. We present a learned image compression framework tailored to solar observations, leveraging two complementary modules: (1) the Inter-Spectral Windowed Graph Embedding (iSWGE), which explicitly models inter-band relationships by representing spectral channels as graph nodes with learned edge features; and (2) the Windowed Spatial Graph Attention and Convolutional Block Attention (WSGA-C), which combines sparse graph attention with convolutional attention to reduce spatial redundancy and emphasize fine-scale structures. Evaluations on the SDOML dataset across six extreme ultraviolet (EUV) channels show that our approach achieves a 20.15%reduction in Mean Spectral Information Divergence (MSID), up to 1.09% PSNR improvement, and a 1.62% log transformed MS-SSIM gain over strong learned baselines, delivering sharper and spectrally faithful reconstructions at comparable bits-per-pixel rates.

TL;DR: 该研究提出了一种结合YOLO目标检测模型和大型语言模型的管道，用于从胸部X光图像生成放射学报告，比较了YOLOv5和YOLOv8的性能，并评估了GPT-4生成报告的临床准确性和文本质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前AI医学影像系统通常只输出结构化预测结果，而放射科医生仍需将这些结果转化为完整的叙述性报告。大型语言模型的出现为从结构化发现生成诊断性叙述提供了新机会，旨在填补这一空白。

Method: 研究设计了一个管道，首先使用YOLOv5和YOLOv8进行胸部X光图像中的异常检测，生成边界框预测和类别标签，然后将这些结构化结果输入大型语言模型（GPT-4）来生成描述性发现和临床总结。

Result: YOLOv5和YOLOv8在检测准确性、推理延迟和生成文本质量方面进行了比较。结果显示AI生成报告与人工报告具有强语义相似性。人类评估表明GPT-4在清晰度方面表现优异（4.88/5），但在自然写作流畅性方面得分较低（2.81/5），表明当前系统能达到临床准确性但在风格上与放射科医生撰写的文本仍有区别。

Conclusion: 该研究证明了结合目标检测模型和大型语言模型生成放射学报告的可行性，系统能够实现临床准确性，但在文本风格的自然流畅性方面仍需改进，以更好地模拟放射科医生的写作风格。

Abstract: Artificial intelligence (AI) has transformed medical imaging, with computer vision (CV) systems achieving state-of-the-art performance in classification and detection tasks. However, these systems typically output structured predictions, leaving radiologists responsible for translating results into full narrative reports. Recent advances in large language models (LLMs), such as GPT-4, offer new opportunities to bridge this gap by generating diagnostic narratives from structured findings. This study introduces a pipeline that integrates YOLOv5 and YOLOv8 for anomaly detection in chest X-ray images with a large language model (LLM) to generate natural-language radiology reports. The YOLO models produce bounding-box predictions and class labels, which are then passed to the LLM to generate descriptive findings and clinical summaries. YOLOv5 and YOLOv8 are compared in terms of detection accuracy, inference latency, and the quality of generated text, as measured by cosine similarity to ground-truth reports. Results show strong semantic similarity between AI and human reports, while human evaluation reveals GPT-4 excels in clarity (4.88/5) but exhibits lower scores for natural writing flow (2.81/5), indicating that current systems achieve clinical accuracy but remain stylistically distinguishable from radiologist-authored text.

Abstract: Recent advances in text-to-video (T2V) generation have achieved good visual quality, yet synthesizing videos that faithfully follow physical laws remains an open challenge. Existing methods mainly based on graphics or prompt extension struggle to generalize beyond simple simulated environments or learn implicit physical reasoning. The scarcity of training data with rich physics interactions and phenomena is also a problem. In this paper, we first introduce a Physics-Augmented video data construction Pipeline, PhyAugPipe, that leverages a vision-language model (VLM) with chain-of-thought reasoning to collect a large-scale training dataset, PhyVidGen-135K. Then we formulate a principled Physics-aware Groupwise Direct Preference Optimization, PhyGDPO, framework that builds upon the groupwise Plackett-Luce probabilistic model to capture holistic preferences beyond pairwise comparisons. In PhyGDPO, we design a Physics-Guided Rewarding (PGR) scheme that embeds VLM-based physics rewards to steer optimization toward physical consistency. We also propose a LoRA-Switch Reference (LoRA-SR) scheme that eliminates memory-heavy reference duplication for efficient training. Experiments show that our method significantly outperforms state-of-the-art open-source methods on PhyGenBench and VideoPhy2. Please check our project page at https://caiyuanhao1998.github.io/project/PhyGDPO for more video results.

TL;DR: EVOL-SAM3：一种零样本推理分割框架，将推理分割重新定义为推理时进化搜索过程，通过"生成-评估-进化"循环迭代优化提示假设，显著超越现有方法


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前推理分割方法存在严重缺陷：监督微调(SFT)存在灾难性遗忘和领域依赖问题；强化学习(RL)训练不稳定且依赖预定义奖励函数；训练免费方法采用静态推理范式，存在推理深度不足、无法自我纠正语言幻觉或空间误解的问题

Method: 提出EVOL-SAM3零样本框架，将推理分割重新定义为推理时进化搜索过程。维护提示假设种群，通过"生成-评估-进化"循环迭代优化：1)视觉竞技场通过无参考成对比赛评估提示适应度；2)语义变异算子注入多样性并纠正语义错误；3)异构竞技场模块整合几何先验与语义推理确保鲁棒最终选择

Result: 在挑战性的ReasonSeg基准测试中，EVOL-SAM3不仅显著超越静态基线方法，还在零样本设置下显著超过完全监督的最先进方法

Conclusion: EVOL-SAM3通过推理时进化搜索范式成功解决了当前推理分割方法的局限性，为复杂上下文依赖语言查询的像素级定位提供了更鲁棒、更准确的解决方案，代码已开源

Abstract: Reasoning Segmentation requires models to interpret complex, context-dependent linguistic queries to achieve pixel-level localization. Current dominant approaches rely heavily on Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) or Reinforcement Learning (RL). However, SFT suffers from catastrophic forgetting and domain dependency, while RL is often hindered by training instability and rigid reliance on predefined reward functions. Although recent training-free methods circumvent these training burdens, they are fundamentally limited by a static inference paradigm. These methods typically rely on a single-pass "generate-then-segment" chain, which suffers from insufficient reasoning depth and lacks the capability to self-correct linguistic hallucinations or spatial misinterpretations. In this paper, we challenge these limitations and propose EVOL-SAM3, a novel zero-shot framework that reformulates reasoning segmentation as an inference-time evolutionary search process. Instead of relying on a fixed prompt, EVOL-SAM3 maintains a population of prompt hypotheses and iteratively refines them through a "Generate-Evaluate-Evolve" loop. We introduce a Visual Arena to assess prompt fitness via reference-free pairwise tournaments, and a Semantic Mutation operator to inject diversity and correct semantic errors. Furthermore, a Heterogeneous Arena module integrates geometric priors with semantic reasoning to ensure robust final selection. Extensive experiments demonstrate that EVOL-SAM3 not only substantially outperforms static baselines but also significantly surpasses fully supervised state-of-the-art methods on the challenging ReasonSeg benchmark in a zero-shot setting.

Conclusion: 提出的方法通过改进互信息估计和相机控制，成功解决了2D到3D的维度转换问题，为跨模态系统在复杂3D场景中的应用提供了有效解决方案

Abstract: Cross-modal systems trained on 2D visual inputs are presented with a dimensional shift when processing 3D scenes. An in-scene camera bridges the dimensionality gap but requires learning a control module. We introduce a new method that improves multivariate mutual information estimates by regret minimisation with derivative-free optimisation. Our algorithm enables off-the-shelf cross-modal systems trained on 2D visual inputs to adapt online to object occlusions and differentiate features. The pairing of expressive measures and value-based optimisation assists control of an in-scene camera to learn directly from the noisy outputs of vision-language models. The resulting pipeline improves performance in cross-modal tasks on multi-object 3D scenes without resorting to pretraining or finetuning.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有CDVQA方法通过监督微调提升性能，但大量失败案例源于决策模糊性而非明显错误预测，即模型对正确答案和强干扰项赋予相似置信度

Method: 提出DARFT框架：1) 使用SFT训练的参考策略挖掘决策模糊样本(DAS)；2) 在挖掘的子集上应用组相对策略优化，利用多样本解码和组内相对优势抑制强干扰项

Result: 实验表明DARFT在SFT基线上获得一致性能提升，特别是在少样本设置下效果显著

Conclusion: 明确优化决策模糊样本对提升CDVQA模型的判别能力和鲁棒性至关重要，DARFT框架无需额外监督即可锐化决策边界

Abstract: Change detection visual question answering (CDVQA) requires answering text queries by reasoning about semantic changes in bi-temporal remote sensing images. A straightforward approach is to boost CDVQA performance with generic vision-language models via supervised fine-tuning (SFT). Despite recent progress, we observe that a significant portion of failures do not stem from clearly incorrect predictions, but from decision ambiguity, where the model assigns similar confidence to the correct answer and strong distractors. To formalize this challenge, we define Decision-Ambiguous Samples (DAS) as instances with a small probability margin between the ground-truth answer and the most competitive alternative. We argue that explicitly optimizing DAS is crucial for improving the discriminability and robustness of CDVQA models. To this end, we propose DARFT, a Decision-Ambiguity-guided Reinforcement Fine-Tuning framework that first mines DAS using an SFT-trained reference policy and then applies group-relative policy optimization on the mined subset. By leveraging multi-sample decoding and intra-group relative advantages, DARFT suppresses strong distractors and sharpens decision boundaries without additional supervision. Extensive experiments demonstrate consistent gains over SFT baselines, particularly under few-shot settings.

Motivation: 现有切片发现方法主要针对图像分类任务，难以应用于检测、分割等多实例任务；现实中的错误切片常涉及复杂视觉关系，现有实例级方法缺乏细粒度推理能力；当前基准多针对特定算法或偏向分类任务，且使用人工合成数据无法反映真实模型失败

Method: 提出SliceLens框架：利用LLM和VLM通过基于视觉的推理生成和验证多样化失败假设，实现细粒度、可解释错误切片的可靠识别；引入FeSD基准，首个专门为实例级视觉任务设计的细粒度错误切片发现评估基准，包含专家标注的精确接地到局部错误区域的切片

Result: 在现有基准和FeSD上均实现SOTA性能，在FeSD上将Precision@10从0.31提升至0.73（提升0.42）；识别出的可解释切片能有效促进模型改进，通过模型修复实验验证了其实际价值

Abstract: Systematic failures of computer vision models on subsets with coherent visual patterns, known as error slices, pose a critical challenge for robust model evaluation. Existing slice discovery methods are primarily developed for image classification, limiting their applicability to multi-instance tasks such as detection, segmentation, and pose estimation. In real-world scenarios, error slices often arise from corner cases involving complex visual relationships, where existing instance-level approaches lacking fine-grained reasoning struggle to yield meaningful insights. Moreover, current benchmarks are typically tailored to specific algorithms or biased toward image classification, with artificial ground truth that fails to reflect real model failures. To address these limitations, we propose SliceLens, a hypothesis-driven framework that leverages LLMs and VLMs to generate and verify diverse failure hypotheses through grounded visual reasoning, enabling reliable identification of fine-grained and interpretable error slices. We further introduce FeSD (Fine-grained Slice Discovery), the first benchmark specifically designed for evaluating fine-grained error slice discovery across instance-level vision tasks, featuring expert-annotated and carefully refined ground-truth slices with precise grounding to local error regions. Extensive experiments on both existing benchmarks and FeSD demonstrate that SliceLens achieves state-of-the-art performance, improving Precision@10 by 0.42 (0.73 vs. 0.31) on FeSD, and identifies interpretable slices that facilitate actionable model improvements, as validated through model repair experiments.

Abstract: The increasing frequency of natural disasters poses severe threats to human lives and leads to substantial economic losses. While 3D semantic segmentation is crucial for post-disaster assessment, existing deep learning models lack datasets specifically designed for post-disaster environments. To address this gap, we constructed a specialized 3D dataset using unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs)-captured aerial footage of Hurricane Ian (2022) over affected areas, employing Structure-from-Motion (SfM) and Multi-View Stereo (MVS) techniques to reconstruct 3D point clouds. We evaluated the state-of-the-art (SOTA) 3D semantic segmentation models, Fast Point Transformer (FPT), Point Transformer v3 (PTv3), and OA-CNNs on this dataset, exposing significant limitations in existing methods for disaster-stricken regions.

Abstract: Accurate and interpretable crop disease diagnosis is essential for agricultural decision-making, yet existing methods often rely on costly supervised fine-tuning and perform poorly under domain shifts. We propose Caption--Prompt--Judge (CPJ), a training-free few-shot framework that enhances Agri-Pest VQA through structured, interpretable image captions. CPJ employs large vision-language models to generate multi-angle captions, refined iteratively via an LLM-as-Judge module, which then inform a dual-answer VQA process for both recognition and management responses. Evaluated on CDDMBench, CPJ significantly improves performance: using GPT-5-mini captions, GPT-5-Nano achieves \textbf{+22.7} pp in disease classification and \textbf{+19.5} points in QA score over no-caption baselines. The framework provides transparent, evidence-based reasoning, advancing robust and explainable agricultural diagnosis without fine-tuning.

Method: 提出协作低秩适应(CLoRA)，包含两个核心组件：1) 基础空间共享 - 所有低秩模块共享一组下/上投影空间，从共享空间获得的低秩矩阵协作构建每个LRM；2) 样本无关多样性增强(SADE) - 正则化这些矩阵表示之间的相似性，鼓励训练过程中产生多样化的表示。

Conclusion: CLoRA通过基础空间共享和多样性增强机制，成功解决了现有LoRA方法在学习性能和参数效率之间的权衡问题，为视觉Transformer微调提供了一种更平衡高效的解决方案。

Abstract: Low-rank adaptation (LoRA) has achieved remarkable success in fine-tuning pre-trained vision transformers for various downstream tasks. Existing studies mainly focus on exploring more parameter-efficient strategies or more effective representation learning schemes. However, these methods either sacrifice fine-tuning performance or introduce excessive trainable parameters, failing to strike a balance between learning performance and parameter efficiency. To address this problem, we propose a novel tuning method named collaborative low-rank adaptation (CLoRA) in this paper. CLoRA consists of base-space sharing and sample-agnostic diversity enhancement (SADE) components. To maintain parameter efficiency while expanding the learning capacity of low-rank modules (LRMs), base-space sharing allows all LRMs to share a set of down/up-projection spaces. In CLoRA, the low-rank matrices obtained from the shared spaces collaboratively construct each LRM. Since the representations extracted by these matrices may contain redundant information, SADE is employed to regularize the similarities among them to encourage diverse representations in the training process. We conduct extensive experiments on widely used image and point cloud datasets to evaluate the performance of CLoRA. Experimental results demonstrate that CLoRA strikes a better balance between learning performance and parameter efficiency, while requiring the fewest GFLOPs for point cloud analysis, compared with the state-of-the-art methods.

Abstract: 3D visual grounding aims to localize the object in 3D point cloud scenes that semantically corresponds to given natural language sentences. It is very critical for roadside infrastructure system to interpret natural languages and localize relevant target objects in complex traffic environments. However, most existing datasets and approaches for 3D visual grounding focus on the indoor and outdoor driving scenes, outdoor monitoring scenarios remain unexplored due to scarcity of paired point cloud-text data captured by roadside infrastructure sensors. In this paper, we introduce a novel task of 3D Visual Grounding for Outdoor Monitoring Scenarios, which enables infrastructure-level understanding of traffic scenes beyond the ego-vehicle perspective. To support this task, we construct MoniRefer, the first real-world large-scale multi-modal dataset for roadside-level 3D visual grounding. The dataset consists of about 136,018 objects with 411,128 natural language expressions collected from multiple complex traffic intersections in the real-world environments. To ensure the quality and accuracy of the dataset, we manually verified all linguistic descriptions and 3D labels for objects. Additionally, we also propose a new end-to-end method, named Moni3DVG, which utilizes the rich appearance information provided by images and geometry and optical information from point cloud for multi-modal feature learning and 3D object localization. Extensive experiments and ablation studies on the proposed benchmarks demonstrate the superiority and effectiveness of our method. Our dataset and code will be released.

Abstract: Object detection in fire rescue scenarios is importance for command and decision-making in firefighting operations. However, existing research still suffers from two main limitations. First, current work predominantly focuses on environments such as mountainous or forest areas, while paying insufficient attention to urban rescue scenes, which are more frequent and structurally complex. Second, existing detection systems include a limited number of classes, such as flames and smoke, and lack a comprehensive system covering key targets crucial for command decisions, such as fire trucks and firefighters. To address the above issues, this paper first constructs a new dataset named "FireRescue" for rescue command, which covers multiple rescue scenarios, including urban, mountainous, forest, and water areas, and contains eight key categories such as fire trucks and firefighters, with a total of 15,980 images and 32,000 bounding boxes. Secondly, to tackle the problems of inter-class confusion and missed detection of small targets caused by chaotic scenes, diverse targets, and long-distance shooting, this paper proposes an improved model named FRS-YOLO. On the one hand, the model introduces a plug-and-play multidi-mensional collaborative enhancement attention module, which enhances the discriminative representation of easily confused categories (e.g., fire trucks vs. ordinary trucks) through cross-dimensional feature interaction. On the other hand, it integrates a dynamic feature sampler to strengthen high-response foreground features, thereby mitigating the effects of smoke occlusion and background interference. Experimental results demonstrate that object detection in fire rescue scenarios is highly challenging, and the proposed method effectively improves the detection performance of YOLO series models in this context.

TL;DR: RadAR：一种基于径向拓扑的并行自回归视觉生成框架，通过环状并行预测和嵌套注意力机制，在保持表征能力的同时显著提升推理效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统自回归模型在视觉生成中采用顺序解码机制，导致推理效率低下。视觉token具有强烈的局部依赖性和空间相关性，但标准光栅扫描解码顺序未能充分利用这一特性。

Method: 提出RadAR框架：1）采用径向拓扑组织生成过程：选择初始token作为中心点，将所有其他token按空间距离分组为多个同心环；2）环状生成：从内向外逐环并行预测同一环内的所有token；3）嵌套注意力机制：动态修正前向传播中的不合理输出，缓解错误累积和模型崩溃。

Result: RadAR在保持视觉场景结构局部性和空间连贯性的同时，显著提高了并行化程度，从而大幅提升了生成效率。

Conclusion: 通过结合径向并行预测和动态输出修正，RadAR为自回归视觉生成提供了一种高效且可并行化的解决方案，有效解决了传统顺序解码的效率瓶颈问题。

Abstract: Inspired by the remarkable success of autoregressive models in language modeling, this paradigm has been widely adopted in visual generation. However, the sequential token-by-token decoding mechanism inherent in traditional autoregressive models leads to low inference efficiency.In this paper, we propose RadAR, an efficient and parallelizable framework designed to accelerate autoregressive visual generation while preserving its representational capacity. Our approach is motivated by the observation that visual tokens exhibit strong local dependencies and spatial correlations with their neighbors--a property not fully exploited in standard raster-scan decoding orders. Specifically, we organize the generation process around a radial topology: an initial token is selected as the starting point, and all other tokens are systematically grouped into multiple concentric rings according to their spatial distances from this center. Generation then proceeds in a ring-wise manner, from inner to outer regions, enabling the parallel prediction of all tokens within the same ring. This design not only preserves the structural locality and spatial coherence of visual scenes but also substantially increases parallelization. Furthermore, to address the risk of inconsistent predictions arising from simultaneous token generation with limited context, we introduce a nested attention mechanism. This mechanism dynamically refines implausible outputs during the forward pass, thereby mitigating error accumulation and preventing model collapse. By integrating radial parallel prediction with dynamic output correction, RadAR significantly improves generation efficiency.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基准测试主要在理想光照条件下评估视觉语言模型，但实际应用中需要模型在包括低光照在内的各种视觉退化条件下都能稳定工作，这一核心需求被长期忽视。

Method: 提出DarkEQA基准测试，通过模拟物理真实的视觉退化（在线性RAW空间建模光照下降和传感器噪声，然后经过ISP渲染流程）来评估模型在低光照条件下的问答能力，隔离感知瓶颈进行可归因的鲁棒性分析。

Result: 评估了多种最先进的视觉语言模型和低光照图像增强模型，系统性地揭示了这些模型在挑战性视觉条件下的局限性。

Conclusion: DarkEQA填补了视觉语言模型在低光照条件下评估的空白，为开发更鲁棒的具身智能体提供了重要基准和分析工具。

Abstract: Vision Language Models (VLMs) are increasingly adopted as central reasoning modules for embodied agents. Existing benchmarks evaluate their capabilities under ideal, well-lit conditions, yet robust 24/7 operation demands performance under a wide range of visual degradations, including low-light conditions at night or in dark environments--a core necessity that has been largely overlooked. To address this underexplored challenge, we present DarkEQA, an open-source benchmark for evaluating EQA-relevant perceptual primitives under multi-level low-light conditions. DarkEQA isolates the perception bottleneck by evaluating question answering from egocentric observations under controlled degradations, enabling attributable robustness analysis. A key design feature of DarkEQA is its physical fidelity: visual degradations are modeled in linear RAW space, simulating physics-based illumination drop and sensor noise followed by an ISP-inspired rendering pipeline. We demonstrate the utility of DarkEQA by evaluating a wide range of state-of-the-art VLMs and Low-Light Image Enhancement (LLIE) models. Our analysis systematically reveals VLMs' limitations when operating under these challenging visual conditions. Our code and benchmark dataset will be released upon acceptance.

Motivation: 当前视频-文本到音频（VT2A）方法存在三个关键局限：1）视觉与文本条件不平衡导致视觉主导；2）缺乏细粒度可控生成的具体定义；3）指令理解和遵循能力弱，现有数据集依赖简短分类标签

Method: 提出EchoFoley任务，使用符号化表示指定视频或指令中声音事件的何时、什么、如何产生；构建EchoFoley-6k大规模专家标注数据集；提出EchoVidia框架，采用基于声音事件的智能生成框架和慢-快思考策略

Conclusion: EchoFoley任务和EchoVidia框架有效解决了现有VT2A方法的局限性，通过符号化声音事件表示实现了细粒度控制，显著提升了视频配乐生成的质量和可控性

Abstract: Sound effects build an essential layer of multimodal storytelling, shaping the emotional atmosphere and the narrative semantics of videos. Despite recent advancement in video-text-to-audio (VT2A), the current formulation faces three key limitations: First, an imbalance between visual and textual conditioning that leads to visual dominance; Second, the absence of a concrete definition for fine-grained controllable generation; Third, weak instruction understanding and following, as existing datasets rely on brief categorical tags. To address these limitations, we introduce EchoFoley, a new task designed for video-grounded sound generation with both event level local control and hierarchical semantic control. Our symbolic representation for sounding events specifies when, what, and how each sound is produced within a video or instruction, enabling fine-grained controls like sound generation, insertion, and editing. To support this task, we construct EchoFoley-6k, a large-scale, expert-curated benchmark containing over 6,000 video-instruction-annotation triplets. Building upon this foundation, we propose EchoVidia a sounding-event-centric agentic generation framework with slow-fast thinking strategy. Experiments show that EchoVidia surpasses recent VT2A models by 40.7% in controllability and 12.5% in perceptual quality.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视频生成模型难以实现对空间（摄像机视角）和时间（运动序列）的独立控制，缺乏能够同时精确控制这两个维度的生成方法。

Method: 1. 引入动画时间嵌入机制，在扩散过程中显式控制输出视频的运动序列；2. 提出时间扭曲训练方案，利用现有多视角数据集模拟时间差异；3. 改进摄像机条件机制，允许从第一帧开始改变摄像机；4. 创建CamxTime合成数据集，提供完全自由的空间-时间视频轨迹。

Conclusion: SpaceTimePilot通过创新的时间嵌入机制、训练策略和数据集构建，成功实现了视频生成中空间和时间的解耦控制，为可控生成渲染提供了新的解决方案。

Abstract: We present SpaceTimePilot, a video diffusion model that disentangles space and time for controllable generative rendering. Given a monocular video, SpaceTimePilot can independently alter the camera viewpoint and the motion sequence within the generative process, re-rendering the scene for continuous and arbitrary exploration across space and time. To achieve this, we introduce an effective animation time-embedding mechanism in the diffusion process, allowing explicit control of the output video's motion sequence with respect to that of the source video. As no datasets provide paired videos of the same dynamic scene with continuous temporal variations, we propose a simple yet effective temporal-warping training scheme that repurposes existing multi-view datasets to mimic temporal differences. This strategy effectively supervises the model to learn temporal control and achieve robust space-time disentanglement. To further enhance the precision of dual control, we introduce two additional components: an improved camera-conditioning mechanism that allows altering the camera from the first frame, and CamxTime, the first synthetic space-and-time full-coverage rendering dataset that provides fully free space-time video trajectories within a scene. Joint training on the temporal-warping scheme and the CamxTime dataset yields more precise temporal control. We evaluate SpaceTimePilot on both real-world and synthetic data, demonstrating clear space-time disentanglement and strong results compared to prior work.

Abstract: The recent advent of 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has marked a significant breakthrough in real-time novel view synthesis. However, the rapid proliferation of 3DGS-based algorithms has created a pressing need for standardized and comprehensive evaluation tools, especially for compression task. Existing benchmarks often lack the specific metrics necessary to holistically assess the unique characteristics of different methods, such as rendering speed, rate distortion trade-offs memory efficiency, and geometric accuracy. To address this gap, we introduce Splatwizard, a unified benchmark toolkit designed specifically for benchmarking 3DGS compression models. Splatwizard provides an easy-to-use framework to implement new 3DGS compression model and utilize state-of-the-art techniques proposed by previous work. Besides, an integrated pipeline that automates the calculation of key performance indicators, including image-based quality metrics, chamfer distance of reconstruct mesh, rendering frame rates, and computational resource consumption is included in the framework as well.

TL;DR: 提出统一框架将3D高斯溅射与实例分割结合，通过可学习特征嵌入和嵌入到标签的解码过程，解决多视图2D标签不一致问题，并使用边界硬挖掘提升性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法处理多视图2D实例标签不一致问题时采用两阶段方法：一些依赖对比学习和超参数敏感的聚类，另一些预处理标签以确保一致性。这些方法存在训练时间长、性能受限的问题，需要更高效的统一框架。

Method: 提出统一框架，在3D高斯原语中引入可学习特征嵌入进行分割，通过新颖的"嵌入到标签"过程高效解码为实例标签。针对边界伪影问题，提出边界硬挖掘策略，但直接应用于特征嵌入不稳定，因此在计算三元组损失前对光栅化特征嵌入应用线性层以稳定训练。

Result: 在ScanNet、Replica3D和Messy-Rooms数据集上，方法在定性和定量评估中均优于基线方法，显著提升了3D实例分割性能。

Conclusion: 提出的统一框架成功整合了3D高斯溅射与实例分割，通过可学习特征嵌入和边界硬挖掘策略，有效解决了多视图标签不一致问题，在减少训练时间的同时提高了分割性能。

Abstract: 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) and Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) have advanced novel-view synthesis. Recent methods extend multi-view 2D segmentation to 3D, enabling instance/semantic segmentation for better scene understanding. A key challenge is the inconsistency of 2D instance labels across views, leading to poor 3D predictions. Existing methods use a two-stage approach in which some rely on contrastive learning with hyperparameter-sensitive clustering, while others preprocess labels for consistency. We propose a unified framework that merges these steps, reducing training time and improving performance by introducing a learnable feature embedding for segmentation in Gaussian primitives. This embedding is then efficiently decoded into instance labels through a novel "Embedding-to-Label" process, effectively integrating the optimization. While this unified framework offers substantial benefits, we observed artifacts at the object boundaries. To address the object boundary issues, we propose hard-mining samples along these boundaries. However, directly applying hard mining to the feature embeddings proved unstable. Therefore, we apply a linear layer to the rasterized feature embeddings before calculating the triplet loss, which stabilizes training and significantly improves performance. Our method outperforms baselines qualitatively and quantitatively on the ScanNet, Replica3D, and Messy-Rooms datasets.

TL;DR: CropTrack是一个针对农业环境多目标跟踪的新型框架，通过结合外观和运动信息来解决传统运动跟踪方法在频繁遮挡和高相似外观下的身份保持问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 农业环境中的多目标跟踪面临重复模式、相似外观、光照突变和频繁遮挡等挑战。现有跟踪器主要依赖运动信息，在目标频繁强遮挡时难以保持身份连续性，而外观相似性又使得外观关联难以集成。

Method: 提出CropTrack框架，集成三个关键技术：1）重排序增强的外观关联；2）一对多关联与基于外观的冲突解决策略；3）指数移动平均原型特征库以改进外观关联。

Result: 在公开农业MOT数据集上评估，CropTrack展现出持续的身份保持能力，优于传统运动跟踪方法。相比最先进方法，在识别F1和关联准确率得分上取得显著提升，同时身份切换次数更低。

Conclusion: CropTrack通过有效结合外观和运动信息，成功解决了农业环境中多目标跟踪的身份保持问题，为相似外观和频繁遮挡场景提供了更鲁棒的跟踪解决方案。

Abstract: Multiple-object tracking (MOT) in agricultural environments presents major challenges due to repetitive patterns, similar object appearances, sudden illumination changes, and frequent occlusions. Contemporary trackers in this domain rely on the motion of objects rather than appearance for association. Nevertheless, they struggle to maintain object identities when targets undergo frequent and strong occlusions. The high similarity of object appearances makes integrating appearance-based association nontrivial for agricultural scenarios. To solve this problem we propose CropTrack, a novel MOT framework based on the combination of appearance and motion information. CropTrack integrates a reranking-enhanced appearance association, a one-to-many association with appearance-based conflict resolution strategy, and an exponential moving average prototype feature bank to improve appearance-based association. Evaluated on publicly available agricultural MOT datasets, CropTrack demonstrates consistent identity preservation, outperforming traditional motion-based tracking methods. Compared to the state of the art, CropTrack achieves significant gains in identification F1 and association accuracy scores with a lower number of identity switches.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出了VLN-MME评估框架，用于系统评估多模态大语言模型在具身导航任务中的零样本能力，发现增强推理链和自反思反而导致性能下降，揭示MLLMs在3D空间推理和上下文感知方面的局限性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多模态大语言模型在多种视觉语言任务中表现出色，但其作为具身智能体（需要多轮对话、空间推理和序列动作预测）的能力仍需深入探索。本文旨在通过构建标准化评估框架，系统研究MLLMs在视觉语言导航任务中的零样本表现。

Method: 提出VLN-MME评估框架：1）将传统导航数据集转化为标准化基准；2）采用高度模块化和易访问的设计简化评估；3）支持跨MLLM架构、智能体设计和导航任务的结构化比较和组件消融实验；4）在基线智能体基础上测试思维链推理和自反思增强策略。

Result: 意外发现：增强基线智能体（加入思维链推理和自反思）反而导致性能下降。这表明MLLMs在具身导航任务中表现出较差的上下文感知能力：虽然能遵循指令并结构化输出，但其3D空间推理保真度较低。

Conclusion: VLN-MME为系统评估通用MLLMs在具身导航场景中的能力奠定了基础，揭示了其在序列决策能力方面的局限性。这些发现为MLLMs作为具身智能体的后训练提供了重要指导。

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities across a wide range of vision-language tasks. However, their performance as embodied agents, which requires multi-round dialogue spatial reasoning and sequential action prediction, needs further exploration. Our work investigates this potential in the context of Vision-and-Language Navigation (VLN) by introducing a unified and extensible evaluation framework to probe MLLMs as zero-shot agents by bridging traditional navigation datasets into a standardized benchmark, named VLN-MME. We simplify the evaluation with a highly modular and accessible design. This flexibility streamlines experiments, enabling structured comparisons and component-level ablations across diverse MLLM architectures, agent designs, and navigation tasks. Crucially, enabled by our framework, we observe that enhancing our baseline agent with Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning and self-reflection leads to an unexpected performance decrease. This suggests MLLMs exhibit poor context awareness in embodied navigation tasks; although they can follow instructions and structure their output, their 3D spatial reasoning fidelity is low. VLN-MME lays the groundwork for systematic evaluation of general-purpose MLLMs in embodied navigation settings and reveals limitations in their sequential decision-making capabilities. We believe these findings offer crucial guidance for MLLM post-training as embodied agents.

Abstract: We introduce FinMMDocR, a novel bilingual multimodal benchmark for evaluating multimodal large language models (MLLMs) on real-world financial numerical reasoning. Compared to existing benchmarks, our work delivers three major advancements. (1) Scenario Awareness: 57.9% of 1,200 expert-annotated problems incorporate 12 types of implicit financial scenarios (e.g., Portfolio Management), challenging models to perform expert-level reasoning based on assumptions; (2) Document Understanding: 837 Chinese/English documents spanning 9 types (e.g., Company Research) average 50.8 pages with rich visual elements, significantly surpassing existing benchmarks in both breadth and depth of financial documents; (3) Multi-Step Computation: Problems demand 11-step reasoning on average (5.3 extraction + 5.7 calculation steps), with 65.0% requiring cross-page evidence (2.4 pages average). The best-performing MLLM achieves only 58.0% accuracy, and different retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) methods show significant performance variations on this task.

Abstract: 3D object detectors are fundamental components of perception systems in autonomous vehicles. While these detectors achieve remarkable performance on standard autonomous driving benchmarks, they often struggle to generalize across different domains - for instance, a model trained in the U.S. may perform poorly in regions like Asia or Europe. This paper presents a novel lidar domain adaptation method based on neuron activation patterns, demonstrating that state-of-the-art performance can be achieved by annotating only a small, representative, and diverse subset of samples from the target domain if they are correctly selected. The proposed approach requires very small annotation budget and, when combined with post-training techniques inspired by continual learning prevent weight drift from the original model. Empirical evaluation shows that the proposed domain adaptation approach outperforms both linear probing and state-of-the-art domain adaptation techniques.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 非门控胸部CT中的冠状动脉钙化（CAC）评分因心脏和呼吸运动伪影而受限，而ECG门控心脏CT在人群筛查和常规成像中应用有限。需要一种方法从广泛可用的非门控CT中准确量化CAC。

Method: 提出ProDM（属性感知渐进校正扩散模型），包含三个关键组件：1）CAC运动模拟数据引擎，从心脏门控CT合成具有多样化运动轨迹的现实非门控采集数据；2）属性感知学习策略，通过可微钙化一致性损失融入钙化特异性先验；3）渐进校正方案，在扩散步骤中逐步减少伪影。

Result: 在真实患者数据集上的实验表明，ProDM显著提高了CAC评分准确性、空间病灶保真度和风险分层性能。真实非门控扫描的读者研究进一步证实ProDM能抑制运动伪影并提高临床可用性。

Conclusion: ProDM展示了渐进式、属性感知框架在从常规胸部CT成像中进行可靠CAC量化的潜力，为非门控CT中的CAC评分提供了一种有效的解决方案。

Abstract: Coronary artery calcium (CAC) scoring from chest CT is a well-established tool to stratify and refine clinical cardiovascular disease risk estimation. CAC quantification relies on the accurate delineation of calcified lesions, but is oftentimes affected by artifacts introduced by cardiac and respiratory motion. ECG-gated cardiac CTs substantially reduce motion artifacts, but their use in population screening and routine imaging remains limited due to gating requirements and lack of insurance coverage. Although identification of incidental CAC from non-gated chest CT is increasingly considered for it offers an accessible and widely available alternative, this modality is limited by more severe motion artifacts. We present ProDM (Property-aware Progressive Correction Diffusion Model), a generative diffusion framework that restores motion-free calcified lesions from non-gated CTs. ProDM introduces three key components: (1) a CAC motion simulation data engine that synthesizes realistic non-gated acquisitions with diverse motion trajectories directly from cardiac-gated CTs, enabling supervised training without paired data; (2) a property-aware learning strategy incorporating calcium-specific priors through a differentiable calcium consistency loss to preserve lesion integrity; and (3) a progressive correction scheme that reduces artifacts gradually across diffusion steps to enhance stability and calcium fidelity. Experiments on real patient datasets show that ProDM significantly improves CAC scoring accuracy, spatial lesion fidelity, and risk stratification performance compared with several baselines. A reader study on real non-gated scans further confirms that ProDM suppresses motion artifacts and improves clinical usability. These findings highlight the potential of progressive, property-aware frameworks for reliable CAC quantification from routine chest CT imaging.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视频生成模型的评估框架通常依赖单帧评估，容易导致"结果黑客"问题——模型通过错误的过程得出正确结论。需要过程感知的评估范式来准确衡量生成式视频推理能力。

Method: 提出VIPER基准，涵盖16个任务，覆盖时间、结构、符号、空间、物理和规划推理。引入过程-结果一致性(POC@r)指标，使用VLM-as-Judge和分层评分标准来评估中间步骤的有效性和最终结果。

Result: 实验表明，最先进的视频模型仅达到约20%的POC@1.0一致性，显示出显著的结果黑客现象。测试时缩放和采样鲁棒性分析揭示了当前视频生成与真正广义视觉推理之间的巨大差距。

Conclusion: 需要过程感知的评估来准确衡量生成式视频推理能力。VIPER基准和POC@r指标为评估视频模型的推理过程提供了新框架，揭示了当前技术的局限性，为未来研究指明了方向。

Abstract: Recent breakthroughs in video generation have demonstrated an emerging capability termed Chain-of-Frames (CoF) reasoning, where models resolve complex tasks through the generation of continuous frames. While these models show promise for Generative Video Reasoning (GVR), existing evaluation frameworks often rely on single-frame assessments, which can lead to outcome-hacking, where a model reaches a correct conclusion through an erroneous process. To address this, we propose a process-aware evaluation paradigm. We introduce VIPER, a comprehensive benchmark spanning 16 tasks across temporal, structural, symbolic, spatial, physics, and planning reasoning. Furthermore, we propose Process-outcome Consistency (POC@r), a new metric that utilizes VLM-as-Judge with a hierarchical rubric to evaluate both the validity of the intermediate steps and the final result. Our experiments reveal that state-of-the-art video models achieve only about 20% POC@1.0 and exhibit a significant outcome-hacking. We further explore the impact of test-time scaling and sampling robustness, highlighting a substantial gap between current video generation and true generalized visual reasoning.

Conclusion: RFL-ReID是比传统L-ReID更具挑战性的新任务，Bi-C2R框架有效解决了无需重新索引历史图库的终身行人重识别问题，实现了特征兼容性和性能平衡。

Abstract: Lifelong person Re-IDentification (L-ReID) exploits sequentially collected data to continuously train and update a ReID model, focusing on the overall performance of all data. Its main challenge is to avoid the catastrophic forgetting problem of old knowledge while training on new data. Existing L-ReID methods typically re-extract new features for all historical gallery images for inference after each update, known as "re-indexing". However, historical gallery data typically suffers from direct saving due to the data privacy issue and the high re-indexing costs for large-scale gallery images. As a result, it inevitably leads to incompatible retrieval between query features extracted by the updated model and gallery features extracted by those before the update, greatly impairing the re-identification performance. To tackle the above issue, this paper focuses on a new task called Re-index Free Lifelong person Re-IDentification (RFL-ReID), which requires performing lifelong person re-identification without re-indexing historical gallery images. Therefore, RFL-ReID is more challenging than L-ReID, requiring continuous learning and balancing new and old knowledge in diverse streaming data, and making the features output by the new and old models compatible with each other. To this end, we propose a Bidirectional Continuous Compatible Representation (Bi-C2R) framework to continuously update the gallery features extracted by the old model to perform efficient L-ReID in a compatible manner. We verify our proposed Bi-C2R method through theoretical analysis and extensive experiments on multiple benchmarks, which demonstrate that the proposed method can achieve leading performance on both the introduced RFL-ReID task and the traditional L-ReID task.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 音频驱动视觉配音面临理想训练数据缺乏的根本挑战，现有基于掩码修复的方法需要同时生成缺失内容和同步唇部，导致视觉伪影、身份漂移和同步性差

Method: 1. 使用Diffusion Transformer作为数据生成器合成理想训练数据（唇部改变的伴生视频）；2. 基于DiT的音频驱动编辑器在视觉对齐的视频对上端到端训练；3. 引入时间步自适应多阶段学习策略解耦编辑目标；4. 提出ContextDubBench基准数据集

Conclusion: 通过将视觉配音重构为条件良好的视频编辑问题，并利用完整对齐的视觉上下文，该方法从根本上解决了现有方法的局限性，实现了高质量的音频驱动视觉配音

Abstract: Audio-driven visual dubbing aims to synchronize a video's lip movements with new speech, but is fundamentally challenged by the lack of ideal training data: paired videos where only a subject's lip movements differ while all other visual conditions are identical. Existing methods circumvent this with a mask-based inpainting paradigm, where an incomplete visual conditioning forces models to simultaneously hallucinate missing content and sync lips, leading to visual artifacts, identity drift, and poor synchronization. In this work, we propose a novel self-bootstrapping framework that reframes visual dubbing from an ill-posed inpainting task into a well-conditioned video-to-video editing problem. Our approach employs a Diffusion Transformer, first as a data generator, to synthesize ideal training data: a lip-altered companion video for each real sample, forming visually aligned video pairs. A DiT-based audio-driven editor is then trained on these pairs end-to-end, leveraging the complete and aligned input video frames to focus solely on precise, audio-driven lip modifications. This complete, frame-aligned input conditioning forms a rich visual context for the editor, providing it with complete identity cues, scene interactions, and continuous spatiotemporal dynamics. Leveraging this rich context fundamentally enables our method to achieve highly accurate lip sync, faithful identity preservation, and exceptional robustness against challenging in-the-wild scenarios. We further introduce a timestep-adaptive multi-phase learning strategy as a necessary component to disentangle conflicting editing objectives across diffusion timesteps, thereby facilitating stable training and yielding enhanced lip synchronization and visual fidelity. Additionally, we propose ContextDubBench, a comprehensive benchmark dataset for robust evaluation in diverse and challenging practical application scenarios.

*Dian Shao,Mingfei Shi,Like Liu*

TL;DR: FineTec：一个用于时间损坏骨架序列细粒度动作识别的统一框架，通过上下文感知补全、空间分解和物理驱动估计实现鲁棒识别


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现实场景中在线姿态估计常产生大量缺失数据，现有方法难以准确恢复时间动态和细粒度空间结构，导致丢失区分相似动作的关键细微运动线索

Method: 1) 上下文感知补全：通过多样化时间掩码从损坏输入恢复基础骨架序列；2) 骨架空间分解：将骨架分为五个语义区域，基于运动方差分为动态和静态子组，通过针对性扰动生成两个增强序列；3) 物理驱动估计：利用拉格朗日动力学估计关节加速度；4) GCN识别头：联合处理融合骨架位置序列和加速度序列

Result: 在粗粒度（NTU-60, NTU-120）和细粒度（Gym99, Gym288）基准测试中显著优于先前方法，在Gym99-severe和Gym288-severe上分别达到89.1%和78.1%的top-1准确率

Conclusion: FineTec通过统一框架有效处理时间损坏骨架序列，在细粒度动作识别中表现出优越的鲁棒性和泛化能力，为解决现实场景中的动作识别挑战提供了有效方案

Abstract: Recognizing fine-grained actions from temporally corrupted skeleton sequences remains a significant challenge, particularly in real-world scenarios where online pose estimation often yields substantial missing data. Existing methods often struggle to accurately recover temporal dynamics and fine-grained spatial structures, resulting in the loss of subtle motion cues crucial for distinguishing similar actions. To address this, we propose FineTec, a unified framework for Fine-grained action recognition under Temporal Corruption. FineTec first restores a base skeleton sequence from corrupted input using context-aware completion with diverse temporal masking. Next, a skeleton-based spatial decomposition module partitions the skeleton into five semantic regions, further divides them into dynamic and static subgroups based on motion variance, and generates two augmented skeleton sequences via targeted perturbation. These, along with the base sequence, are then processed by a physics-driven estimation module, which utilizes Lagrangian dynamics to estimate joint accelerations. Finally, both the fused skeleton position sequence and the fused acceleration sequence are jointly fed into a GCN-based action recognition head. Extensive experiments on both coarse-grained (NTU-60, NTU-120) and fine-grained (Gym99, Gym288) benchmarks show that FineTec significantly outperforms previous methods under various levels of temporal corruption. Specifically, FineTec achieves top-1 accuracies of 89.1% and 78.1% on the challenging Gym99-severe and Gym288-severe settings, respectively, demonstrating its robustness and generalizability.

*Yi-Chuan Huang,Hao-Jen Chien,Chin-Yang Lin,Ying-Huan Chen,Yu-Lun Liu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: GaMO通过多视角外推而非生成新视角来改进稀疏视图3D重建，解决了现有扩散方法在视角覆盖、几何一致性和计算效率方面的局限性，实现了SOTA重建质量和25倍加速。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有稀疏视图3D重建方法存在三个关键限制：已知视角外围覆盖不足、生成视图间几何不一致、计算流程昂贵。扩散方法通过生成新视角来增强训练数据，但仍有这些缺陷。

Method: 提出GaMO框架，将稀疏视图重建重新定义为多视角外推问题。从现有相机姿态扩展视野而非生成新视角，采用多视角条件化和几何感知去噪策略，以零样本方式无需训练。

Result: 在Replica和ScanNet++数据集上，使用3、6、9个输入视图实现了SOTA重建质量（PSNR和LPIPS指标），相比SOTA扩散方法获得25倍加速，处理时间低于10分钟。

Conclusion: GaMO通过多视角外推方法有效解决了稀疏视图重建中的几何一致性和覆盖范围问题，同时大幅提升了计算效率，为实际应用提供了实用解决方案。

Abstract: Recent advances in 3D reconstruction have achieved remarkable progress in high-quality scene capture from dense multi-view imagery, yet struggle when input views are limited. Various approaches, including regularization techniques, semantic priors, and geometric constraints, have been implemented to address this challenge. Latest diffusion-based methods have demonstrated substantial improvements by generating novel views from new camera poses to augment training data, surpassing earlier regularization and prior-based techniques. Despite this progress, we identify three critical limitations in these state-of-the-art approaches: inadequate coverage beyond known view peripheries, geometric inconsistencies across generated views, and computationally expensive pipelines. We introduce GaMO (Geometry-aware Multi-view Outpainter), a framework that reformulates sparse-view reconstruction through multi-view outpainting. Instead of generating new viewpoints, GaMO expands the field of view from existing camera poses, which inherently preserves geometric consistency while providing broader scene coverage. Our approach employs multi-view conditioning and geometry-aware denoising strategies in a zero-shot manner without training. Extensive experiments on Replica and ScanNet++ demonstrate state-of-the-art reconstruction quality across 3, 6, and 9 input views, outperforming prior methods in PSNR and LPIPS, while achieving a $25\times$ speedup over SOTA diffusion-based methods with processing time under 10 minutes.

*Paulo Cavalin,Cassia Sanctos,Marcelo Grave,Claudio Pinhanez,Yago Primerano*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: CAT框架用于评估和可视化大语言模型在可控输入变化下的准确性与响应一致性之间的相互作用，以多项选择题基准为案例研究。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前评估实践主要关注模型能力如准确性或基准分数，而一致性测量对于在高风险实际应用中部署LLMs至关重要。虽然这两个维度应独立评估，但它们的相互依赖性也需要考虑，以实现对LLMs更细致的评估。

Method: CAT框架核心是"一致性-准确性关系(CAR)曲线"，可视化模型准确性如何随一致性要求增加而变化，由"最小一致性准确性(MCA)"指标定义。进一步提出"一致性导向鲁棒性估计(CORE)"指数，结合CAR曲线的面积和形状来量化准确性与一致性之间的权衡。

Result: 在多个多项选择题基准上对通用和领域特定LLMs进行了实际演示，展示了框架的有效性。还概述了CAT如何通过可适应的评分函数扩展到多项选择题任务之外，支持长格式、开放式评估。

Conclusion: CAT框架提供了一种系统方法来评估和可视化LLMs的准确性与一致性之间的相互作用，为模型评估提供了更全面的视角，特别适用于需要高可靠性的实际应用场景。

Abstract: We introduce \textsc{CAT}, a framework designed to evaluate and visualize the \emph{interplay} of \emph{accuracy} and \emph{response consistency} of Large Language Models (LLMs) under controllable input variations, using multiple-choice (MC) benchmarks as a case study. Current evaluation practices primarily focus on model capabilities such as accuracy or benchmark scores and, more recently, measuring consistency is being considered an essential property for deploying LLMs in high-stake, real-world applications. We argue in this paper that although both dimensions should still be evaluated independently, their inter-dependency also need to be considered for a more nuanced evaluation of LLMs. At the core of \textsc{CAT} are the \emph{Consistency-Accuracy Relation (CAR)} curves, which visualize how model accuracy varies with increasing consistency requirements, as defined by the \emph{Minimum-Consistency Accuracy (MCA)} metric. We further propose the \emph{Consistency-Oriented Robustness Estimate (CORE)} index, a global metric that combines the area and shape of the CAR curve to quantify the trade-off between accuracy and consistency. We present a practical demonstration of our framework across a diverse set of generalist and domain-specific LLMs, evaluated on multiple MC benchmarks. We also outline how \textsc{CAT} can be extended beyond MC tasks to support long-form, open-ended evaluations through adaptable scoring functions.

Motivation: 大型语言模型在英语到代码生成方面表现出色，但这种进展尚未扩展到低资源语言。针对孟加拉语到Python代码生成的需求，需要开发专门的方法来克服语言资源限制

Method: 提出BanglaCodeAct框架，采用基于智能体的方法，利用多智能体提示和迭代自校正。框架使用开源多语言LLM，在Thought-Code-Observation循环中实现动态代码生成、测试和优化，避免任务特定的微调

Result: 在mHumanEval数据集上评估多个小参数开源LLM，Qwen3-8B结合BanglaCodeAct表现最佳：开发集pass@1准确率94.0%，盲测集71.6%，为孟加拉语到Python翻译建立了新基准

Conclusion: BanglaCodeAct为低资源语言的可靠代码生成提供了有效解决方案，证明了基于智能体推理方法的潜力，为孟加拉语编程教育、工具开发和应用提供了新途径

Abstract: LLMs excel at code generation from English prompts, but this progress has not extended to low-resource languages. We address Bangla-to-Python code generation by introducing BanglaCodeAct, an agent-based framework that leverages multi-agent prompting and iterative self-correction. Unlike prior approaches relying on task-specific fine-tuning, BanglaCodeAct employs an open-source multilingual LLM within a Thought-Code-Observation loop, enabling dynamic generation, testing, and refinement of code from Bangla instructions. We benchmark several small-parameter open-source LLMs and evaluate their effectiveness on the mHumanEval dataset for Bangla NL2Code. Our results show that Qwen3-8B, when deployed with BanglaCodeAct, achieves the best performance, with pass@1 accuracy of 94.0\% on the development set and 71.6\% on the blind test set. These results establish a new benchmark for Bangla-to-Python translation and highlight the potential of agent-based reasoning for reliable code generation in low-resource languages.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为安全关键的药品领域文档理解建立受控、可复现的基准测试，评估预训练文本布局模型在噪声OCR和异构模板下的鲁棒性，探索像素信息和几何信息的互补作用。

Method: 构建包含扫描药品运输单据的PharmaShip数据集，采用实体中心的评估协议，标准化预处理、数据划分和优化流程，基准测试五种代表性基线模型（LiLT、LayoutLMv3-base、GeoLayoutLM及其RORE增强变体）。

Result: 像素信息和显式几何信息提供互补的归纳偏置，但单独使用都不充分；注入阅读顺序导向的正则化能持续改进序列实体识别和实体链接，获得最鲁棒的配置；更长的位置覆盖稳定了页面后期预测并减少了截断伪影；阅读顺序预测在词级别准确但在片段级别具有挑战性。

Conclusion: PharmaShip为药品领域的安全关键文档理解建立了受控、可复现的基准，强调序列感知约束作为结构建模的可迁移偏置的重要性，并发布了公开数据集。

Abstract: We present PharmaShip, a real-world Chinese dataset of scanned pharmaceutical shipping documents designed to stress-test pre-trained text-layout models under noisy OCR and heterogeneous templates. PharmaShip covers three complementary tasks-sequence entity recognition (SER), relation extraction (RE), and reading order prediction (ROP)-and adopts an entity-centric evaluation protocol to minimize confounds across architectures. We benchmark five representative baselines spanning pixel-aware and geometry-aware families (LiLT, LayoutLMv3-base, GeoLayoutLM and their available RORE-enhanced variants), and standardize preprocessing, splits, and optimization. Experiments show that pixels and explicit geometry provide complementary inductive biases, yet neither alone is sufficient: injecting reading-order-oriented regularization consistently improves SER and EL and yields the most robust configuration, while longer positional coverage stabilizes late-page predictions and reduces truncation artifacts. ROP is accurate at the word level but challenging at the segment level, reflecting boundary ambiguity and long-range crossings. PharmaShip thus establishes a controlled, reproducible benchmark for safety-critical document understanding in the pharmaceutical domain and highlights sequence-aware constraints as a transferable bias for structure modeling. We release the dataset at https://github.com/KevinYuLei/PharmaShip.

Method: 提出Luca-Noise Reflex Protocol (LN-RP)框架，向初始生成状态注入随机噪声种子，在152个生成周期中观察语言行为的非线性转变。

Conclusion: LN-RP协议为研究大语言模型中的反射性生成、涌现行为和长程语言连贯性提供了可重复的方法。

Abstract: This paper introduces the Luca-Noise Reflex Protocol (LN-RP), a computational framework for analyzing noise-driven persona emergence in large language models. By injecting stochastic noise seeds into the initial generation state, we observe nonlinear transitions in linguistic behavior across 152 generation cycles. Our results reveal three stable persona modes with distinct entropy signatures, and demonstrate that external noise sources can reliably induce phase transitions in reflexive generation dynamics. Quantitative evaluation confirms consistent persona retention and significant differences across modes (p < 0.01). The protocol provides a reproducible method for studying reflexive generation, emergent behavior, and longrange linguistic coherence in LLMs.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前LLM安全机制主要关注明显有害内容，但用户可以通过隐蔽的重新表述来伪装有害意图，而现有安全训练数据存在这一显著缺口

Method: 引入HarmTransform多智能体辩论框架，通过多个智能体之间的迭代批判和精炼，系统地将有害查询转化为更隐蔽的形式，同时保留其潜在有害意图

Result: 实验表明HarmTransform在生成有效查询转换方面显著优于标准基线；同时分析揭示辩论具有双重作用：既能锐化转换并提高隐蔽性，也可能引入主题偏移和不必要的复杂性

Conclusion: 多智能体辩论在生成全面安全训练数据方面既有前景也有局限性，需要平衡转换质量和复杂性控制

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are equipped with safety mechanisms to detect and block harmful queries, yet current alignment approaches primarily focus on overtly dangerous content and overlook more subtle threats. However, users can often disguise harmful intent through covert rephrasing that preserves malicious objectives while appearing benign, which creates a significant gap in existing safety training data. To address this limitation, we introduce HarmTransform, a multi-agent debate framework for systematically transforming harmful queries into stealthier forms while preserving their underlying harmful intent. Our framework leverages iterative critique and refinement among multiple agents to generate high-quality, covert harmful query transformations that can be used to improve future LLM safety alignment. Experiments demonstrate that HarmTransform significantly outperforms standard baselines in producing effective query transformations. At the same time, our analysis reveals that debate acts as a double-edged sword: while it can sharpen transformations and improve stealth, it may also introduce topic shifts and unnecessary complexity. These insights highlight both the promise and the limitations of multi-agent debate for generating comprehensive safety training data.

Conclusion: LLMs能够在德州扑克这样的不完全信息环境中学习到对随机环境的内部表示，表明其具备处理部分可观测决策过程的能力

Abstract: Transformer-based large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated strong reasoning abilities across diverse fields, from solving programming challenges to competing in strategy-intensive games such as chess. Prior work has shown that LLMs can develop emergent world models in games of perfect information, where internal representations correspond to latent states of the environment. In this paper, we extend this line of investigation to domains of incomplete information, focusing on poker as a canonical partially observable Markov decision process (POMDP). We pretrain a GPT-style model on Poker Hand History (PHH) data and probe its internal activations. Our results demonstrate that the model learns both deterministic structure, such as hand ranks, and stochastic features, such as equity, without explicit instruction. Furthermore, by using primarily nonlinear probes, we demonstrated that these representations are decodeable and correlate with theoretical belief states, suggesting that LLMs are learning their own representation of the stochastic environment of Texas Hold'em Poker.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在线性别歧视内容日益微妙且依赖上下文，传统检测方法难以应对。其解释涉及语言、心理、法律和文化等多维度，导致标注数据存在混合甚至矛盾信号。这些不一致性加上标签稀缺和类别不平衡，造成决策边界不稳定，使微调模型忽略更微妙、代表性不足的危害形式。

Method: 提出两阶段框架：1) 训练阶段采用类别平衡焦点损失、类别感知批处理和事后阈值校准来缓解标签不平衡和噪声监督；2) 推理阶段使用动态路由机制，高置信度案例直接分类，不确定实例则升级到新颖的"协作专家判断"模块，该模块提示多个人物角色并通过法官模型整合其推理。

Result: 在多个基准测试中取得最先进结果：EXIST 2025 Task 1.1上F1分数提升+2.72%，EDOS Tasks A和B上分别获得+4.48%和+1.30%的增益。

Conclusion: 该框架通过统一针对性训练程序和选择性推理机制，有效解决了微妙性别歧视内容检测中的数据不足、噪声和概念模糊性三大挑战，显著提升了检测性能。

Abstract: Sexist content online increasingly appears in subtle, context-dependent forms that evade traditional detection methods. Its interpretation often depends on overlapping linguistic, psychological, legal, and cultural dimensions, which produce mixed and sometimes contradictory signals, even in annotated datasets. These inconsistencies, combined with label scarcity and class imbalance, result in unstable decision boundaries and cause fine-tuned models to overlook subtler, underrepresented forms of harm. Together, these limitations point to the need for a design that explicitly addresses the combined effects of (i) underrepresentation, (ii) noise, and (iii) conceptual ambiguity in both data and model predictions. To address these challenges, we propose a two-stage framework that unifies (i) targeted training procedures to adapt supervision to scarce and noisy data with (ii) selective, reasoning-based inference to handle ambiguous or borderline cases. Our training setup applies class-balanced focal loss, class-aware batching, and post-hoc threshold calibration to mitigate label imbalance and noisy supervision. At inference time, a dynamic routing mechanism classifies high-confidence cases directly and escalates uncertain instances to a novel \textit{Collaborative Expert Judgment} (CEJ) module, which prompts multiple personas and consolidates their reasoning through a judge model. Our approach achieves state-of-the-art results across several benchmarks, with a +2.72\% improvement in F1 on the EXIST 2025 Task 1.1, and a gains of +4.48\% and +1.30\% on the EDOS Tasks A and B, respectively.

<details>

Motivation: 传统推测解码中草稿模型与目标模型过度对齐，限制了性能只能达到目标模型水平，需要突破这一限制

Method: 在标准推测解码基础上，引入动态熵惩罚机制：当两个模型都呈现高熵且top-N预测重叠时，拒绝相应token并由目标LLM重新采样

Result: 在多个推理基准测试中，EASD一致优于现有SD方法，大多数情况下甚至超越目标LLM本身，同时效率与SD相当

Conclusion: EASD通过熵感知机制实现了性能突破，在保持推测解码效率的同时可能超越目标模型性能，为LLM推理加速提供了新思路

Abstract: Speculative decoding (SD) accelerates large language model (LLM) reasoning by using a small draft model to generate candidate tokens, which the target LLM either accepts directly or regenerates upon rejection. However, excessive alignment between the draft and target models constrains SD to the performance of the target LLM. To address this limitation, we propose Entropy-Aware Speculative Decoding (EASD), a training-free enhancement. Building on standard SD, EASD incorporates a dynamic entropy-based penalty. At each decoding step, we employ the entropy of the sampling distribution to quantify model uncertainty. When both models exhibit high entropy with substantial overlap among their top-N predictions, the corresponding token is rejected and re-sampled by the target LLM. This penalty prevents low-confidence errors from propagating. By incorporating draft-model verification, EASD enables the possibility of surpassing the target model's inherent performance. Experiments across multiple reasoning benchmarks demonstrate that EASD consistently outperforms existing SD methods and, in most cases, surpasses the target LLM itself. We further prove that the efficiency of EASD is comparable to that of SD. The code can be found in the Supplementary Materials.

Method: 1. 将MiMo-Audio的预训练数据扩展到超过1亿小时音频数据；2. 开发系统性的少样本学习能力评估框架；3. 在后期训练阶段，策划多样化的指令调优语料库，并在音频理解和生成中引入思维机制。

Result: MiMo-Audio-7B-Base在语音智能和音频理解基准测试中达到开源模型SOTA性能，能泛化到训练数据中未见的任务（如语音转换、风格迁移、语音编辑），并展示强大的语音延续能力。MiMo-Audio-7B-Instruct在音频理解基准（MMSU、MMAU、MMAR、MMAU-Pro）、口语对话基准（Big Bench Audio、MultiChallenge Audio）和指令TTS评估中达到开源SOTA，接近或超越闭源模型。

Conclusion: 通过大规模音频预训练数据扩展，MiMo-Audio实现了音频任务的少样本学习能力，证明了GPT-3范式在音频领域的适用性，为音频语言模型的发展提供了新的方向。

Abstract: Existing audio language models typically rely on task-specific fine-tuning to accomplish particular audio tasks. In contrast, humans are able to generalize to new audio tasks with only a few examples or simple instructions. GPT-3 has shown that scaling next-token prediction pretraining enables strong generalization capabilities in text, and we believe this paradigm is equally applicable to the audio domain. By scaling MiMo-Audio's pretraining data to over one hundred million of hours, we observe the emergence of few-shot learning capabilities across a diverse set of audio tasks. We develop a systematic evaluation of these capabilities and find that MiMo-Audio-7B-Base achieves SOTA performance on both speech intelligence and audio understanding benchmarks among open-source models. Beyond standard metrics, MiMo-Audio-7B-Base generalizes to tasks absent from its training data, such as voice conversion, style transfer, and speech editing. MiMo-Audio-7B-Base also demonstrates powerful speech continuation capabilities, capable of generating highly realistic talk shows, recitations, livestreaming and debates. At the post-training stage, we curate a diverse instruction-tuning corpus and introduce thinking mechanisms into both audio understanding and generation. MiMo-Audio-7B-Instruct achieves open-source SOTA on audio understanding benchmarks (MMSU, MMAU, MMAR, MMAU-Pro), spoken dialogue benchmarks (Big Bench Audio, MultiChallenge Audio) and instruct-TTS evaluations, approaching or surpassing closed-source models.

TL;DR: 比较两种基于Transformer的新闻偏见检测模型的可解释性研究，使用SHAP解释分析模型决策机制，发现架构和训练选择显著影响模型可靠性


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 新闻文本自动偏见检测广泛用于支持新闻分析和媒体问责，但人们对偏见检测模型如何做出决策或为何失败知之甚少，需要理解不同模型架构如何操作语言偏见

Method: 使用SHAP解释方法对两种基于Transformer的偏见检测模型进行可解释性比较研究：1) 在BABE数据集上微调的偏见检测器；2) 领域自适应预训练RoBERTa模型在BABE数据集上微调。分析正确和错误预测的词级归因，表征不同模型架构如何操作语言偏见

Result: 两种模型都关注相似的评价语言类别，但在如何将这些信号整合到预测中差异显著。偏见检测器模型对假阳性赋予比真阳性更强的内部证据，表明归因强度与预测正确性不匹配，导致系统性地过度标记中性新闻内容。领域自适应模型表现出与预测结果更好对齐的归因模式，假阳性减少63%。模型错误源于不同的语言机制，假阳性由话语层面的模糊性而非显性偏见线索驱动

Conclusion: 偏见检测系统的可解释性感知评估至关重要，架构和训练选择对模型可靠性和在新闻背景下的部署适用性有决定性影响。领域自适应方法能产生更可靠、误报更少的偏见检测模型

Abstract: Automated bias detection in news text is heavily used to support journalistic analysis and media accountability, yet little is known about how bias detection models arrive at their decisions or why they fail. In this work, we present a comparative interpretability study of two transformer-based bias detection models: a bias detector fine-tuned on the BABE dataset and a domain-adapted pre-trained RoBERTa model fine-tuned on the BABE dataset, using SHAP-based explanations. We analyze word-level attributions across correct and incorrect predictions to characterize how different model architectures operationalize linguistic bias. Our results show that although both models attend to similar categories of evaluative language, they differ substantially in how these signals are integrated into predictions. The bias detector model assigns stronger internal evidence to false positives than to true positives, indicating a misalignment between attribution strength and prediction correctness and contributing to systematic over-flagging of neutral journalistic content. In contrast, the domain-adaptive model exhibits attribution patterns that better align with prediction outcomes and produces 63\% fewer false positives. We further demonstrate that model errors arise from distinct linguistic mechanisms, with false positives driven by discourse-level ambiguity rather than explicit bias cues. These findings highlight the importance of interpretability-aware evaluation for bias detection systems and suggest that architectural and training choices critically affect both model reliability and deployment suitability in journalistic contexts.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 自适应提示策略通过将检索信息分块并顺序提示LLM，在保持问答性能的同时减少token使用量


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLM扩展上下文窗口虽然便于融入目标知识，但也会引入更多无关信息，这会阻碍模型生成过程并降低性能。需要解决长上下文带来的信息过载问题。

Method: 设计自适应提示策略：将检索信息分割成较小的块，然后顺序提示LLM使用每个块来回答问题。通过调整块大小，在纳入相关信息与减少无关信息之间取得平衡。

Result: 在三个开放域问答数据集上的实验结果表明，自适应策略在使用更少token的情况下，性能与标准提示相当。分析发现，当遇到信息不足时，LLM经常生成错误答案而不是拒绝回答，这是主要的错误来源。

Conclusion: 自适应提示策略能有效处理长上下文中的信息过载问题。研究揭示了LLM在信息不足时倾向于生成错误答案而非拒绝回答的问题，这凸显了需要进一步研究增强LLM在面对信息不足时有效拒绝请求的能力。

Abstract: The success of expanded context windows in Large Language Models (LLMs) has driven increased use of broader context in retrieval-augmented generation. We investigate the use of LLMs for retrieval augmented question answering. While longer contexts make it easier to incorporate targeted knowledge, they introduce more irrelevant information that hinders the model's generation process and degrades its performance. To address the issue, we design an adaptive prompting strategy which involves splitting the retrieved information into smaller chunks and sequentially prompting a LLM to answer the question using each chunk. Adjusting the chunk size allows a trade-off between incorporating relevant information and reducing irrelevant information. Experimental results on three open-domain question answering datasets demonstrate that the adaptive strategy matches the performance of standard prompting while using fewer tokens. Our analysis reveals that when encountering insufficient information, the LLM often generates incorrect answers instead of declining to respond, which constitutes a major source of error. This finding highlights the need for further research into enhancing LLMs' ability to effectively decline requests when faced with inadequate information.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 基于机制可解释性研究发现中间注意力层编码token级假设并迭代优化，探索利用模型内部token预测生成对抗样本，相比提示或梯度攻击更具内部一致性和合理性

Method: 从注意力中间层提取token分布作为对抗扰动，在ArgQuality数据集上进行论证质量评估实验，使用LLaMA-3.1-Instruct-8B同时作为生成器和评估器

Result: 注意力层生成的对抗样本导致评估性能显著下降且保持语义相似性，但某些层和位置的替换会引入语法退化，限制了实际有效性

Conclusion: 中间层表示作为对抗样本来源具有潜力但存在局限性，为压力测试LLM评估流程提供了原则性方法

Abstract: Recent advances in mechanistic interpretability suggest that intermediate attention layers encode token-level hypotheses that are iteratively refined toward the final output. In this work, we exploit this property to generate adversarial examples directly from attention-layer token distributions. Unlike prompt-based or gradient-based attacks, our approach leverages model-internal token predictions, producing perturbations that are both plausible and internally consistent with the model's own generation process. We evaluate whether tokens extracted from intermediate layers can serve as effective adversarial perturbations for downstream evaluation tasks. We conduct experiments on argument quality assessment using the ArgQuality dataset, with LLaMA-3.1-Instruct-8B serving as both the generator and evaluator. Our results show that attention-based adversarial examples lead to measurable drops in evaluation performance while remaining semantically similar to the original inputs. However, we also observe that substitutions drawn from certain layers and token positions can introduce grammatical degradation, limiting their practical effectiveness. Overall, our findings highlight both the promise and current limitations of using intermediate-layer representations as a principled source of adversarial examples for stress-testing LLM-based evaluation pipelines.

Motivation: 解决金融数值推理QA任务因缺乏金融领域知识导致的错误问题。尽管LLMs有进展，但金融数值问题仍具挑战性，需要特定领域知识和复杂多步数值推理。

Method: 实现多检索器RAG系统，检索外部领域知识和内部问题上下文，利用最新LLM处理任务。使用SecBERT编码器进行领域特定训练，构建神经符号模型，并进行提示式LLM生成器实验。

Result: 领域特定训练显著提升性能，最佳神经符号模型超越FinQA基准。最佳提示式LLM生成器达到SOTA性能，提升>7%，但仍低于人类专家水平。发现小模型幻觉损失与外部知识增益的权衡，大模型外部事实增益通常超过幻觉损失。

Conclusion: 领域特定训练具有潜在优越性能，最新LLM在少样本学习优化的数值推理能力得到增强。研究强调了在金融数值推理任务中平衡幻觉损失与外部知识获取的重要性。

Abstract: This research project addresses the errors of financial numerical reasoning Question Answering (QA) tasks due to the lack of domain knowledge in finance. Despite recent advances in Large Language Models (LLMs), financial numerical questions remain challenging because they require specific domain knowledge in finance and complex multi-step numeric reasoning. We implement a multi-retriever Retrieval Augmented Generators (RAG) system to retrieve both external domain knowledge and internal question contexts, and utilize the latest LLM to tackle these tasks. Through comprehensive ablation experiments and error analysis, we find that domain-specific training with the SecBERT encoder significantly contributes to our best neural symbolic model surpassing the FinQA paper's top model, which serves as our baseline. This suggests the potential superior performance of domain-specific training. Furthermore, our best prompt-based LLM generator achieves the state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance with significant improvement (>7%), yet it is still below the human expert performance. This study highlights the trade-off between hallucinations loss and external knowledge gains in smaller models and few-shot examples. For larger models, the gains from external facts typically outweigh the hallucination loss. Finally, our findings confirm the enhanced numerical reasoning capabilities of the latest LLM, optimized for few-shot learning.

TL;DR: 提出一个分析框架，将学生回答内容信号与教师评分倾向分离，通过建模教师历史作为动态先验，结合文本嵌入和统计调整，量化各信号对评分的影响，提升评分透明度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 自动化评分常混淆学生回答内容与教师评分倾向，缺乏透明度。需要分离内容信号与评分者倾向，使评分判断可见且可审计，支持教师反思评分实践。

Method: 使用去识别化的ASSISTments数学回答数据，建模教师历史为动态先验，从句子嵌入提取文本表示，采用中心化和残差化处理减少提示和教师混杂因素。使用时序验证的线性模型量化各信号贡献，通过投影可视化模型分歧供定性检查。

Result: 教师先验对评分预测影响显著；先验与内容嵌入结合时效果最佳（AUC~0.815），纯内容模型虽高于随机但较弱（AUC~0.626）。调整评分者效应可锐化残差内容表示，保留更多信息维度，揭示语义证据支持理解而非表面回答差异的情况。

Conclusion: 该框架将嵌入从单纯特征转化为学习分析工具，使教师和研究者能够检查评分实践与学生推理证据的一致性或冲突，支持反思性教学实践。

Abstract: Open-ended responses are central to learning, yet automated scoring often conflates what students wrote with how teachers grade. We present an analytics-first framework that separates content signals from rater tendencies, making judgments visible and auditable via analytics. Using de-identified ASSISTments mathematics responses, we model teacher histories as dynamic priors and derive text representations from sentence embeddings, incorporating centering and residualization to mitigate prompt and teacher confounds. Temporally-validated linear models quantify the contributions of each signal, and a projection surfaces model disagreements for qualitative inspection. Results show that teacher priors heavily influence grade predictions; the strongest results arise when priors are combined with content embeddings (AUC~0.815), while content-only models remain above chance but substantially weaker (AUC~0.626). Adjusting for rater effects sharpens the residual content representation, retaining more informative embedding dimensions and revealing cases where semantic evidence supports understanding as opposed to surface-level differences in how students respond. The contribution presents a practical pipeline that transforms embeddings from mere features into learning analytics for reflection, enabling teachers and researchers to examine where grading practices align (or conflict) with evidence of student reasoning and learning.

TL;DR: HGMem是一种基于超图的记忆机制，用于增强多步检索增强生成(RAG)系统，通过动态超图结构捕获事实间的高阶关联，提升全局理解和复杂推理能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有RAG系统中的记忆模块主要作为被动存储，仅积累孤立事实用于输入压缩和生成新查询。这种静态设计忽略了原始事实间的高阶关联，而这些关联组合能为后续步骤提供更强指导，导致表示能力有限、推理碎片化、全局理解能力弱。

Method: 提出HGMem超图记忆机制，将记忆表示为超图结构，其中超边对应不同的记忆单元。该机制能够渐进形成记忆内的高阶交互，围绕核心问题连接事实和思考，演化为集成的情境化知识结构，为后续深度推理提供强命题。

Result: 在多个为全局理解设计的挑战性数据集上进行评估，大量实验和深入分析表明，HGMem方法持续改进多步RAG性能，在多样化任务上显著优于强基线系统。

Conclusion: HGMem将记忆概念从简单存储扩展到动态表达结构，通过超图表示捕获高阶关联，有效解决了现有RAG系统在复杂推理和全局理解方面的局限性，提升了多步推理和知识演化能力。

Abstract: Multi-step retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) has become a widely adopted strategy for enhancing large language models (LLMs) on tasks that demand global comprehension and intensive reasoning. Many RAG systems incorporate a working memory module to consolidate retrieved information. However, existing memory designs function primarily as passive storage that accumulates isolated facts for the purpose of condensing the lengthy inputs and generating new sub-queries through deduction. This static nature overlooks the crucial high-order correlations among primitive facts, the compositions of which can often provide stronger guidance for subsequent steps. Therefore, their representational strength and impact on multi-step reasoning and knowledge evolution are limited, resulting in fragmented reasoning and weak global sense-making capacity in extended contexts. We introduce HGMem, a hypergraph-based memory mechanism that extends the concept of memory beyond simple storage into a dynamic, expressive structure for complex reasoning and global understanding. In our approach, memory is represented as a hypergraph whose hyperedges correspond to distinct memory units, enabling the progressive formation of higher-order interactions within memory. This mechanism connects facts and thoughts around the focal problem, evolving into an integrated and situated knowledge structure that provides strong propositions for deeper reasoning in subsequent steps. We evaluate HGMem on several challenging datasets designed for global sense-making. Extensive experiments and in-depth analyses show that our method consistently improves multi-step RAG and substantially outperforms strong baseline systems across diverse tasks.

Result: LoZA在长上下文场景中实现显著加速，LongCat-Flash-Exp模型可高效处理高达100万tokens，支持高效长期推理和长视野智能体能力

Conclusion: LoZA为现有全注意力模型提供了一种有效的稀疏化转换方案，在有限计算预算下实现了长上下文处理能力的显著提升

Abstract: We introduce LongCat ZigZag Attention (LoZA), which is a sparse attention scheme designed to transform any existing full-attention models into sparse versions with rather limited compute budget. In long-context scenarios, LoZA can achieve significant speed-ups both for prefill-intensive (e.g., retrieval-augmented generation) and decode-intensive (e.g., tool-integrated reasoning) cases. Specifically, by applying LoZA to LongCat-Flash during mid-training, we serve LongCat-Flash-Exp as a long-context foundation model that can swiftly process up to 1 million tokens, enabling efficient long-term reasoning and long-horizon agentic capabilities.

Motivation: 现有的大语言模型和监督方法在中文拼写纠错任务中存在局限性：对新型错误缺乏鲁棒性，且依赖昂贵的标注数据。需要一种无需标注的鲁棒纠错方法。

Method: 提出CEC-Zero框架：1）从干净文本合成错误输入；2）通过语义相似性和候选一致性计算聚类共识奖励；3）使用PPO优化策略。该框架具有无偏奖励和收敛的理论保证。

Result: 在9个基准测试中，CEC-Zero比监督基线方法高出10-13个F1分数点，比强LLM微调方法高出5-8个点，建立了无需标注的鲁棒、可扩展CSC范式。

Conclusion: CEC-Zero为大规模中文拼写纠错提供了一种零监督强化学习解决方案，释放了大语言模型在噪声文本处理中的潜力，实现了无需标注的鲁棒纠错。

Abstract: Large-scale Chinese spelling correction (CSC) remains critical for real-world text processing, yet existing LLMs and supervised methods lack robustness to novel errors and rely on costly annotations. We introduce CEC-Zero, a zero-supervision reinforcement learning framework that addresses this by enabling LLMs to correct their own mistakes. CEC-Zero synthesizes errorful inputs from clean text, computes cluster-consensus rewards via semantic similarity and candidate agreement, and optimizes the policy with PPO. It outperforms supervised baselines by 10--13 F$_1$ points and strong LLM fine-tunes by 5--8 points across 9 benchmarks, with theoretical guarantees of unbiased rewards and convergence. CEC-Zero establishes a label-free paradigm for robust, scalable CSC, unlocking LLM potential in noisy text pipelines.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法依赖人工定义的概念（如过度思考、反思）在词级别监督分析推理过程，但无法捕捉全部潜在推理行为，许多行为难以在token空间中定义

Method: 提出RISE框架：将思维链轨迹分割为句子级"步骤"，在步骤级激活上训练稀疏自编码器（SAEs），发现编码不同推理行为的推理向量

Result: SAEs发现可解释行为（如反思、回溯），这些行为在解码器列空间中占据可分离区域；对SAE衍生向量进行干预可控制放大或抑制特定推理行为；SAEs还能捕获结构特性（如响应长度），并发现超出人工监督的新行为（如置信度相关向量）

Conclusion: 无监督潜在发现方法在解释和可控引导LLM推理方面具有潜力，为理解模型内部推理机制提供了新途径

Abstract: Despite the growing reasoning capabilities of recent large language models (LLMs), their internal mechanisms during the reasoning process remain underexplored. Prior approaches often rely on human-defined concepts (e.g., overthinking, reflection) at the word level to analyze reasoning in a supervised manner. However, such methods are limited, as it is infeasible to capture the full spectrum of potential reasoning behaviors, many of which are difficult to define in token space. In this work, we propose an unsupervised framework (namely, RISE: Reasoning behavior Interpretability via Sparse auto-Encoder) for discovering reasoning vectors, which we define as directions in the activation space that encode distinct reasoning behaviors. By segmenting chain-of-thought traces into sentence-level 'steps' and training sparse auto-encoders (SAEs) on step-level activations, we uncover disentangled features corresponding to interpretable behaviors such as reflection and backtracking. Visualization and clustering analyses show that these behaviors occupy separable regions in the decoder column space. Moreover, targeted interventions on SAE-derived vectors can controllably amplify or suppress specific reasoning behaviors, altering inference trajectories without retraining. Beyond behavior-specific disentanglement, SAEs capture structural properties such as response length, revealing clusters of long versus short reasoning traces. More interestingly, SAEs enable the discovery of novel behaviors beyond human supervision. We demonstrate the ability to control response confidence by identifying confidence-related vectors in the SAE decoder space. These findings underscore the potential of unsupervised latent discovery for both interpreting and controllably steering reasoning in LLMs.

Abstract: Distinguishing fake or untrue news from satire or humor poses a unique challenge due to their overlapping linguistic features and divergent intent. This study develops WISE (Web Information Satire and Fakeness Evaluation) framework which benchmarks eight lightweight transformer models alongside two baseline models on a balanced dataset of 20,000 samples from Fakeddit, annotated as either fake news or satire. Using stratified 5-fold cross-validation, we evaluate models across comprehensive metrics including accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, ROC-AUC, PR-AUC, MCC, Brier score, and Expected Calibration Error. Our evaluation reveals that MiniLM, a lightweight model, achieves the highest accuracy (87.58%) among all models, while RoBERTa-base achieves the highest ROC-AUC (95.42%) and strong accuracy (87.36%). DistilBERT offers an excellent efficiency-accuracy trade-off with 86.28\% accuracy and 93.90\% ROC-AUC. Statistical tests confirm significant performance differences between models, with paired t-tests and McNemar tests providing rigorous comparisons. Our findings highlight that lightweight models can match or exceed baseline performance, offering actionable insights for deploying misinformation detection systems in real-world, resource-constrained settings.

TL;DR: iCLP框架让大语言模型通过隐式认知生成紧凑的潜在计划，在数学推理和代码生成任务中显著提升准确性和效率，同时保持可解释性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于显式文本计划的推理方法面临两个主要挑战：1) LLM幻觉导致计划不准确；2) 任务特定问题的高度多样性使得生成有效计划困难。受人类隐式认知启发，需要一种更紧凑、泛化性更强的规划方式。

Method: iCLP框架包含三个关键步骤：1) 从现有逐步推理轨迹中蒸馏显式计划；2) 通过向量量化自编码器和码本学习这些计划的离散表示（潜在计划）；3) 在成对的潜在计划和相应推理步骤上微调LLM，使模型学会在推理过程中进行隐式规划。

Result: 实验结果表明，iCLP使LLM能够在潜在空间进行规划，同时在语言空间进行推理。该方法在数学推理和代码生成任务中显著提高了准确性和效率，并展现出强大的跨域泛化能力，同时保持了思维链推理的可解释性。

Conclusion: iCLP通过将人类隐式认知原理应用于LLM规划，成功解决了显式文本规划的局限性。该方法不仅提升了推理性能，还保持了模型的可解释性，为LLM的隐式规划开辟了新方向。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs), when guided by explicit textual plans, can perform reliable step-by-step reasoning during problem-solving. However, generating accurate and effective textual plans remains challenging due to LLM hallucinations and the high diversity of task-specific questions. To address this, we draw inspiration from human Implicit Cognition (IC), the subconscious process by which decisions are guided by compact, generalized patterns learned from past experiences without requiring explicit verbalization. We propose iCLP, a novel framework that enables LLMs to adaptively generate latent plans (LPs), which are compact encodings of effective reasoning instructions. iCLP first distills explicit plans from existing step-by-step reasoning trajectories. It then learns discrete representations of these plans via a vector-quantized autoencoder coupled with a codebook. Finally, by fine-tuning LLMs on paired latent plans and corresponding reasoning steps, the models learn to perform implicit planning during reasoning. Experimental results on mathematical reasoning and code generation tasks demonstrate that, with iCLP, LLMs can plan in latent space while reasoning in language space. This approach yields significant improvements in both accuracy and efficiency and, crucially, demonstrates strong cross-domain generalization while preserving the interpretability of chain-of-thought reasoning.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLM在医疗、法律、金融等决策关键领域应用日益增多，但其可靠性存在不确定性：经常产生过度自信的错误、在输入变化时性能下降、缺乏清晰的不确定性估计。现有评估方法零散，仅关注孤立方面。

Method: 引入Composite Reliability Score (CRS)统一框架，整合校准性、鲁棒性和不确定性量化三个维度。在五个QA数据集上对十个领先的开源LLM进行实验，评估基线性能、扰动影响和校准方法。

Result: CRS提供稳定的模型排名，揭示单一指标遗漏的隐藏故障模式，并表明最可靠的系统在准确性、鲁棒性和校准不确定性之间取得平衡。

Conclusion: CRS框架为LLM可靠性评估提供了统一、全面的方法，有助于识别在决策关键应用中真正可靠的模型，强调需要平衡多个可靠性维度而非仅关注准确性。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) like LLaMA, Mistral, and Gemma are increasingly used in decision-critical domains such as healthcare, law, and finance, yet their reliability remains uncertain. They often make overconfident errors, degrade under input shifts, and lack clear uncertainty estimates. Existing evaluations are fragmented, addressing only isolated aspects. We introduce the Composite Reliability Score (CRS), a unified framework that integrates calibration, robustness, and uncertainty quantification into a single interpretable metric. Through experiments on ten leading open-source LLMs across five QA datasets, we assess performance under baselines, perturbations, and calibration methods. CRS delivers stable model rankings, uncovers hidden failure modes missed by single metrics, and highlights that the most dependable systems balance accuracy, robustness, and calibrated uncertainty.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 开发高性能、参数高效的机器翻译模型，通过系统化训练框架提升翻译质量，在保持较小参数规模的同时超越大型模型性能。

Method: 采用多阶段训练管道：通用与MT导向预训练、监督微调、策略蒸馏和强化学习，支持术语干预、上下文感知翻译和格式保持等高级约束。

Result: HY-MT1.5-1.8B在中文-外语和英文-外语任务中全面超越大型开源基线（如Tower-Plus-72B）和商业API，达到Gemini-3.0-Pro约90%性能；HY-MT1.5-7B在其规模类别中达到SOTA，在Flores-200上达到Gemini-3.0-Pro的95%性能，并在WMT25和普通话-少数民族语言测试集上超越Gemini-3.0-Pro。

Conclusion: HY-MT1.5系列模型通过整体训练框架实现了卓越的参数效率和翻译性能，为通用和专业翻译任务提供了高度竞争力的解决方案，特别是在较小参数规模下仍能保持接近或超越超大私有模型的性能。

Abstract: In this report, we introduce our latest translation models, HY-MT1.5-1.8B and HY-MT1.5-7B, a new family of machine translation models developed through a holistic training framework tailored for high-performance translation. Our methodology orchestrates a multi-stage pipeline that integrates general and MT-oriented pre-training, supervised fine-tuning, on-policy distillation, and reinforcement learning. HY-MT1.5-1.8B, the 1.8B-parameter model demonstrates remarkable parameter efficiency, comprehensively outperforming significantly larger open-source baselines (e.g., Tower-Plus-72B, Qwen3-32B) and mainstream commercial APIs (e.g., Microsoft Translator, Doubao Translator) in standard Chinese-foreign and English-foreign tasks. It achieves approximately 90% of the performance of ultra-large proprietary models such as Gemini-3.0-Pro, while marginally trailing Gemini-3.0-Pro on WMT25 and Mandarin-minority language benchmarks, it maintains a substantial lead over other competing models. Furthermore, HY-MT1.5-7B establishes a new state-of-the-art for its size class, achieving 95% of Gemini-3.0-Pro's performance on Flores-200 and surpassing it on the challenging WMT25 and Mandarin-minority language test sets. Beyond standard translation, the HY-MT1.5 series supports advanced constraints, including terminology intervention, context-aware translation, and format preservation. Extensive empirical evaluations confirm that both models offer highly competitive, robust solutions for general and specialized translation tasks within their respective parameter scales.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种用于掩码扩散语言模型（MDLMs）的激活导向框架，通过对比示例计算层间导向向量，实现高效推理时控制，无需模拟去噪轨迹。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 掩码扩散语言模型通过迭代去噪过程生成文本，具有掩码并行解码和与自回归大语言模型竞争的性能优势。然而，MDLMs在推理时控制和引导的有效机制尚未得到充分探索，需要开发高效的推理时控制方法。

Method: 提出基于激活导向的框架：1）使用对比示例通过单次前向传播计算层间导向向量；2）在反向扩散的每一步应用这些导向方向；3）无需模拟去噪轨迹，实现高效推理时控制。

Result: 在LLaDA-8B-Instruct模型上的实验表明，该方法能够可靠地调制高层次属性。消融实验检验了导向在transformer子模块和token范围（提示vs.响应）上的效果。

Conclusion: 该激活导向框架为掩码扩散语言模型提供了有效的推理时控制机制，能够高效地引导文本生成过程，调节模型输出属性。

Abstract: Masked diffusion language models (MDLMs) generate text through an iterative denoising process. They have recently gained attention due to mask-parallel decoding and competitive performance with autoregressive large language models. However, effective mechanisms for inference-time control and steering in MDLMs remain largely unexplored. We present an activation-steering framework for MDLMs that computes layer-wise steering vectors from a single forward pass using contrastive examples, without simulating the denoising trajectory. These directions are applied at every reverse-diffusion step, yielding an efficient inference-time control mechanism. Experiments on LLaDA-8B-Instruct demonstrate reliable modulation of high-level attributes, with ablations examining the effects of steering across transformer sub-modules and token scope (prompt vs.\ response).

TL;DR: 本文提出大型情感世界模型(LEWM)，通过构建情感-原因-方法(EWH)数据集，将情感因素系统性地融入世界模型，以更准确地预测情感驱动的社会行为。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有大型语言模型主要关注物理世界规律建模，缺乏对情感因素的系统探索。情感作为世界知识的关键组成部分，显著影响人类决策。研究表明移除情感相关信息会降低推理性能，因此需要构建能够建模情感的世界模型。

Method: 基于心智理论启发，提出大型情感世界模型(LEWM)。首先构建情感-原因-方法(EWH)数据集，将情感融入因果关系，支持推理行为发生原因和情感如何驱动未来世界状态。LEWM显式建模情感状态、视觉观察和行动，使世界模型能够预测未来状态和情感转变。

Result: 实验结果显示，LEWM在情感驱动的社会行为预测方面更准确，同时在基础任务上保持与通用世界模型相当的性能。

Conclusion: 情感是世界理解的关键因素，LEWM通过系统整合情感建模，提升了世界模型对社会行为的预测能力，为构建更全面的世界知识模型提供了新方向。

Abstract: World Models serve as tools for understanding the current state of the world and predicting its future dynamics, with broad application potential across numerous fields. As a key component of world knowledge, emotion significantly influences human decision-making. While existing Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown preliminary capability in capturing world knowledge, they primarily focus on modeling physical-world regularities and lack systematic exploration of emotional factors. In this paper, we first demonstrate the importance of emotion in understanding the world by showing that removing emotionally relevant information degrades reasoning performance. Inspired by theory of mind, we further propose a Large Emotional World Model (LEWM). Specifically, we construct the Emotion-Why-How (EWH) dataset, which integrates emotion into causal relationships and enables reasoning about why actions occur and how emotions drive future world states. Based on this dataset, LEWM explicitly models emotional states alongside visual observations and actions, allowing the world model to predict both future states and emotional transitions. Experimental results show that LEWM more accurately predicts emotion-driven social behaviors while maintaining comparable performance to general world models on basic tasks.

Abstract: TeleChat3-MoE is the latest series of TeleChat large language models, featuring a Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architecture with parameter counts ranging from 105 billion to over one trillion,trained end-to-end on Ascend NPU cluster. This technical report mainly presents the underlying training infrastructure that enables reliable and efficient scaling to frontier model sizes. We detail systematic methodologies for operator-level and end-to-end numerical accuracy verification, ensuring consistency across hardware platforms and distributed parallelism strategies. Furthermore, we introduce a suite of performance optimizations, including interleaved pipeline scheduling, attention-aware data scheduling for long-sequence training,hierarchical and overlapped communication for expert parallelism, and DVM-based operator fusion. A systematic parallelization framework, leveraging analytical estimation and integer linear programming, is also proposed to optimize multi-dimensional parallelism configurations. Additionally, we present methodological approaches to cluster-level optimizations, addressing host- and device-bound bottlenecks during large-scale training tasks. These infrastructure advancements yield significant throughput improvements and near-linear scaling on clusters comprising thousands of devices, providing a robust foundation for large-scale language model development on hardware ecosystems.

TL;DR: MedKGI：基于医学知识图谱的临床诊断框架，通过约束推理、信息增益问题选择和结构化状态跟踪，解决LLMs在临床诊断中的幻觉、冗余问题和对话不一致性


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前大型语言模型在临床诊断中存在三个关键限制：1）由于缺乏已验证知识基础而产生医学内容幻觉；2）提出冗余或低效问题而非有助于诊断进展的区分性问题；3）在多轮对话中失去连贯性，导致矛盾或不一致的结论。需要模拟真实临床场景中迭代、假设驱动的诊断推理过程。

Method: 提出MedKGI诊断框架，整合医学知识图谱将推理约束在已验证的医学本体中；基于信息增益选择问题以最大化诊断效率；采用OSCE格式的结构化状态来保持跨轮次的一致证据跟踪。

Result: 在临床基准测试中，MedKGI在诊断准确性和询问效率方面均优于强大的LLM基线，平均提高对话效率30%，同时保持最先进的准确性。

Conclusion: MedKGI通过整合医学知识图谱、信息增益驱动的问题选择和结构化状态跟踪，有效解决了LLMs在临床诊断中的关键限制，实现了更接近真实临床实践的迭代诊断推理。

Abstract: Recent advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated significant promise in clinical diagnosis. However, current models struggle to emulate the iterative, diagnostic hypothesis-driven reasoning of real clinical scenarios. Specifically, current LLMs suffer from three critical limitations: (1) generating hallucinated medical content due to weak grounding in verified knowledge, (2) asking redundant or inefficient questions rather than discriminative ones that hinder diagnostic progress, and (3) losing coherence over multi-turn dialogues, leading to contradictory or inconsistent conclusions. To address these challenges, we propose MedKGI, a diagnostic framework grounded in clinical practices. MedKGI integrates a medical knowledge graph (KG) to constrain reasoning to validated medical ontologies, selects questions based on information gain to maximize diagnostic efficiency, and adopts an OSCE-format structured state to maintain consistent evidence tracking across turns. Experiments on clinical benchmarks show that MedKGI outperforms strong LLM baselines in both diagnostic accuracy and inquiry efficiency, improving dialogue efficiency by 30% on average while maintaining state-of-the-art accuracy.

Motivation: 需要开发一个能够同时处理专利和科学文献的语言相似性模型，以更好地预测专利与论文之间的引用关系，并探索不同司法管辖区引用行为的差异。

Method: 基于SPECTER2模型在专利数据上进行微调，创建Pat-SPECTER模型；通过"赛马式"评估比较8种语言相似性模型在预测可信专利-论文引用方面的性能；在两个真实场景中验证模型能力。

Result: Pat-SPECTER模型在预测专利-论文引用方面表现最佳；验证了美国专利因诚信义务而倾向于引用语义相似度较低的论文，与其他主要司法管辖区存在差异。

Conclusion: Pat-SPECTER是有效的专利-文献相似性分析工具，揭示了不同司法管辖区引用行为的系统性差异，模型已开源供学术界和从业者使用。

Abstract: We develop a language similarity model suitable for working with patents and scientific publications at the same time. In a horse race-style evaluation, we subject eight language (similarity) models to predict credible Patent-Paper Citations. We find that our Pat-SPECTER model performs best, which is the SPECTER2 model fine-tuned on patents. In two real-world scenarios (separating patent-paper-pairs and predicting patent-paper-pairs) we demonstrate the capabilities of the Pat-SPECTER. We finally test the hypothesis that US patents cite papers that are semantically less similar than in other large jurisdictions, which we posit is because of the duty of candor. The model is open for the academic community and practitioners alike.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: DATAMASK是一个用于大规模预训练数据选择的高效联合学习框架，通过将选择过程视为掩码学习问题，同时优化质量和多样性指标，在万亿规模数据集上实现高效数据筛选。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有数据选择方法在万亿规模预训练数据集（如FineWeb和DCLM）上存在局限性：基于质量指标的选择在长期预训练中表现出严重的收益递减，而基于多样性指标的选择会移除过多高质量样本，这两种方法都限制了预训练LLM的能力。

Method: DATAMASK将数据选择过程视为掩码学习问题，采用基于策略梯度的优化方法：迭代采样数据掩码，基于预定义目标计算策略梯度，更新掩码采样逻辑。通过策略梯度优化和各种加速增强，相比贪心算法将选择时间减少98.9%。

Result: 从15万亿token的FineWeb数据集中选择约10%的子集（FineWeb-Mask），在12个不同任务上评估：1.5B密集模型性能提升3.2%，7B MoE模型性能提升1.9%。

Conclusion: DATAMASK框架能够在大规模预训练数据选择中同时优化质量和多样性指标，显著提高训练效率和模型性能，为万亿规模token数据集的高效筛选提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: A fine-grained data recipe is crucial for pre-training large language models, as it can significantly enhance training efficiency and model performance. One important ingredient in the recipe is to select samples based on scores produced by defined rules, LLM judgment, or statistical information in embeddings, which can be roughly categorized into quality and diversity metrics. Due to the high computational cost when applied to trillion-scale token pre-training datasets such as FineWeb and DCLM, these two or more types of metrics are rarely considered jointly in a single selection process. However, in our empirical study, selecting samples based on quality metrics exhibit severe diminishing returns during long-term pre-training, while selecting on diversity metrics removes too many valuable high-quality samples, both of which limit pre-trained LLMs' capabilities. Therefore, we introduce DATAMASK, a novel and efficient joint learning framework designed for large-scale pre-training data selection that can simultaneously optimize multiple types of metrics in a unified process, with this study focusing specifically on quality and diversity metrics. DATAMASK approaches the selection process as a mask learning problem, involving iterative sampling of data masks, computation of policy gradients based on predefined objectives with sampled masks, and updating of mask sampling logits. Through policy gradient-based optimization and various acceleration enhancements, it significantly reduces selection time by 98.9% compared to greedy algorithm, enabling our study to explore joint learning within trillion-scale tokens. With DATAMASK, we select a subset of about 10% from the 15 trillion-token FineWeb dataset, termed FineWeb-Mask. Evaluated across 12 diverse tasks, we achieves significant improvements of 3.2% on a 1.5B dense model and 1.9% on a 7B MoE model.

TL;DR: 该研究创建了首个欧盟分类法合规评估的公开基准数据集，并系统评估了LLM在定性（经济活动识别）和定量（KPI预测）任务上的表现，发现LLM在定量任务上表现不佳，但可作为人类专家的辅助工具。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 欧盟分类法合规流程手动且资源密集，LLM虽有望实现自动化但缺乏公开基准数据集，阻碍了相关研究进展。

Method: 从190份企业报告中构建结构化数据集，包含真实经济活动和经济绩效指标，并首次系统评估LLM在核心合规工作流中的表现，包括定性经济活动识别和定量KPI预测任务。

Result: LLM在定性经济活动识别任务中表现中等，多步智能体框架略微提升精度；在零样本设置的定量KPI预测任务中完全失败。发现简洁元数据常优于完整非结构化报告，且模型置信度分数校准不佳。

Conclusion: LLM尚未准备好实现完全自动化，但可作为人类专家的强大辅助工具。该数据集为未来研究提供了公开基准。

Abstract: The manual, resource-intensive process of complying with the EU Taxonomy presents a significant challenge for companies. While Large Language Models (LLMs) offer a path to automation, research is hindered by a lack of public benchmark datasets. To address this gap, we introduce a novel, structured dataset from 190 corporate reports, containing ground-truth economic activities and quantitative Key Performance Indicators (KPIs). We use this dataset to conduct the first systematic evaluation of LLMs on the core compliance workflow. Our results reveal a clear performance gap between qualitative and quantitative tasks. LLMs show moderate success in the qualitative task of identifying economic activities, with a multi-step agentic framework modestly enhancing precision. Conversely, the models comprehensively fail at the quantitative task of predicting financial KPIs in a zero-shot setting. We also discover a paradox, where concise metadata often yields superior performance to full, unstructured reports, and find that model confidence scores are poorly calibrated. We conclude that while LLMs are not ready for full automation, they can serve as powerful assistive tools for human experts. Our dataset provides a public benchmark for future research.

TL;DR: FIGR通过强化学习将视觉思维整合到多轮推理中，构建视觉表示来外化中间结构假设，在复杂数学推理任务上超越纯文本基线


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 复杂推理问题常涉及隐含的空间、几何和结构关系，这些关系在文本中未明确编码。纯文本推理难以表示复杂场景中的全局结构约束，需要新的方法来增强推理的稳定性和可靠性。

Method: FIGR通过端到端强化学习将主动视觉思维整合到多轮推理中。系统在问题解决过程中构建视觉表示来外化中间结构假设，并自适应地调节何时以及如何调用视觉推理，从而实现对难以从文本单独捕捉的全局结构属性的更稳定和连贯的推理。

Result: 在具有挑战性的数学推理基准测试中，FIGR优于强大的纯文本思维链基线。具体来说，FIGR在AIME 2025上将基础模型提升了13.12%，在BeyondAIME上提升了11.00%，证明了图引导多模态推理在增强复杂推理稳定性和可靠性方面的有效性。

Conclusion: FIGR通过整合主动视觉思维和自适应视觉推理调用，显著提升了复杂推理任务的性能，特别是在处理隐含空间、几何和结构关系方面，为多模态推理系统的发展提供了新方向。

Abstract: Complex reasoning problems often involve implicit spatial, geometric, and structural relationships that are not explicitly encoded in text. While recent reasoning models have achieved strong performance across many domains, purely text-based reasoning struggles to represent global structural constraints in complex settings. In this paper, we introduce FIGR, which integrates active visual thinking into multi-turn reasoning via end-to-end reinforcement learning. FIGR externalizes intermediate structural hypotheses by constructing visual representations during problem solving. By adaptively regulating when and how visual reasoning should be invoked, FIGR enables more stable and coherent reasoning over global structural properties that are difficult to capture from text alone. Experiments on challenging mathematical reasoning benchmarks demonstrate that FIGR outperforms strong text-only chain-of-thought baselines. In particular, FIGR improves the base model by 13.12% on AIME 2025 and 11.00% on BeyondAIME, highlighting the effectiveness of figure-guided multimodal reasoning in enhancing the stability and reliability of complex reasoning.

Motivation: 金融领域LLM增强一直是工业应用焦点。以往模型如BloombergGPT和Baichuan-Finance主要关注知识增强，但随着金融服务复杂性加深，需要模型不仅具备领域知识，还要有强大的金融推理和智能体能力。

Method: 提出通用的多阶段训练范式：1) 在金融语料上进行持续预训练(CPT)巩固知识基础；2) 细粒度后训练管道：金融SFT → 金融推理RL → 金融智能体RL → 与真实业务场景对齐的通用RL。

Result: QianfanHuijin在各种权威金融基准测试中表现优异。消融研究证实针对性的推理RL和智能体RL阶段在各自能力上带来显著提升。

Conclusion: 验证了研究动机，表明这种细粒度、渐进式的后训练方法有望成为各种工业增强LLM的主流范式。

Abstract: Domain-specific enhancement of Large Language Models (LLMs) within the financial context has long been a focal point of industrial application. While previous models such as BloombergGPT and Baichuan-Finance primarily focused on knowledge enhancement, the deepening complexity of financial services has driven a growing demand for models that possess not only domain knowledge but also robust financial reasoning and agentic capabilities. In this paper, we present QianfanHuijin, a financial domain LLM, and propose a generalizable multi-stage training paradigm for industrial model enhancement.
  Our approach begins with Continual Pre-training (CPT) on financial corpora to consolidate the knowledge base. This is followed by a fine-grained Post-training pipeline designed with increasing specificity: starting with Financial SFT, progressing to Finance Reasoning RL and Finance Agentic RL, and culminating in General RL aligned with real-world business scenarios. Empirical results demonstrate that QianfanHuijin achieves superior performance across various authoritative financial benchmarks. Furthermore, ablation studies confirm that the targeted Reasoning RL and Agentic RL stages yield significant gains in their respective capabilities. These findings validate our motivation and suggest that this fine-grained, progressive post-training methodology is poised to become a mainstream paradigm for various industrial-enhanced LLMs.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有Transformer模型在词句级任务表现良好，但难以有效表示长文档（特别是法律和医学领域）。稀疏注意力机制能处理更长输入但资源密集且难以捕获完整文档上下文，分层Transformer效率更好但无法清晰解释文档不同部分间的关系。人类通过略读重点段落理解整体信息的策略启发了本研究。

Method: 提出自监督对比学习框架：随机掩码文档段落，使用基于自然语言推理（NLI）的对比目标，将被掩码段落与相关部分对齐，同时与不相关部分保持距离，模拟人类信息合成过程。

Result: 在法医和生物医学文本上的实验证实，该方法在准确性和计算效率方面均取得显著提升。

Conclusion: 通过模拟人类略读策略的自监督对比学习框架，成功解决了长文档表示难题，在保持计算效率的同时获得了更丰富的文档表示，为法律和医学等专业领域的长文档处理提供了有效方案。

Abstract: Although transformer-based models have shown strong performance in word- and sentence-level tasks, effectively representing long documents, especially in fields like law and medicine, remains difficult. Sparse attention mechanisms can handle longer inputs, but are resource-intensive and often fail to capture full-document context. Hierarchical transformer models offer better efficiency but do not clearly explain how they relate different sections of a document. In contrast, humans often skim texts, focusing on important sections to understand the overall message. Drawing from this human strategy, we introduce a new self-supervised contrastive learning framework that enhances long document representation. Our method randomly masks a section of the document and uses a natural language inference (NLI)-based contrastive objective to align it with relevant parts while distancing it from unrelated ones. This mimics how humans synthesize information, resulting in representations that are both richer and more computationally efficient. Experiments on legal and biomedical texts confirm significant gains in both accuracy and efficiency.

Method: 比较多种方法：1）零样本提示不同规模的LLM；2）微调mT5等较小模型（使用三种数据增强方法和多语言迁移）；3）LLM翻译管道方法（源语言→英语→摘要→翻译回源语言）。使用五种不同指标进行评估

Result: 发现：1）相似参数规模的LLM性能存在差异；2）多语言微调的mT5基线在多数指标上优于其他方法，包括零样本LLM；3）LLM作为评估器在低资源语言上可能可靠性较低

Conclusion: 对于低资源语言文本摘要，微调较小的多语言模型（如mT5）是有效方法，而零样本LLM方法表现较差，且需要更可靠的评估方法

Abstract: Automatic text summarization has achieved high performance in high-resourced languages like English, but comparatively less attention has been given to summarization in less-resourced languages. This work compares a variety of different approaches to summarization from zero-shot prompting of LLMs large and small to fine-tuning smaller models like mT5 with and without three data augmentation approaches and multilingual transfer. We also explore an LLM translation pipeline approach, translating from the source language to English, summarizing and translating back. Evaluating with five different metrics, we find that there is variation across LLMs in their performance across similar parameter sizes, that our multilingual fine-tuned mT5 baseline outperforms most other approaches including zero-shot LLM performance for most metrics, and that LLM as judge may be less reliable on less-resourced languages.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 开发了一个用于IELTS写作考试的智能修订平台，通过设计研究(DBR)方法从基于规则的系统演进到基于Transformer的评分模型，提供个性化反馈并显著提升考生成绩。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统IELTS备考方法缺乏针对写作评分标准的个性化反馈，需要开发能够提供定制化指导的智能平台来弥补这一不足。

Method: 采用设计研究(DBR)方法进行迭代开发：早期周期使用基于规则的自动评分系统，第4周期采用DistilBERT Transformer模型加回归头进行评分，第5周期实现自适应反馈功能。平台架构将对话指导与专用写作界面分离以减少认知负荷。

Result: 基于规则的早期系统存在中段压缩、低准确性和负R²值等问题。DistilBERT模型显著改善评分性能（MAE=0.66，正R²值）。自适应反馈使考生成绩平均提高0.060个分数段（p=0.011，Cohen's d=0.504），但效果因修订策略而异。

Conclusion: 自动化反馈功能最适合作为人工教学的补充，保守的表面级修正比激进的结构干预更可靠。挑战在于评估高分段作文，未来研究需要纳入真实考生纵向研究和官方考官验证。

Abstract: This paper presents the design, development, and evaluation of a proposed revision platform assisting candidates for the International English Language Testing System (IELTS) writing exam. Traditional IELTS preparation methods lack personalised feedback, catered to the IELTS writing rubric. To address these shortcomings, the platform features an attractive user interface (UI), an Automated Essay Scoring system (AES), and targeted feedback tailored to candidates and the IELTS writing rubric. The platform architecture separates conversational guidance from a dedicated writing interface to reduce cognitive load and simulate exam conditions. Through iterative, Design-Based Research (DBR) cycles, the study progressed from rule-based to transformer-based with a regression head scoring, mounted with adaptive feedback.
  Early cycles (2-3) revealed fundamental limitations of rule-based approaches: mid-band compression, low accuracy, and negative $R^2$ values. DBR Cycle 4 implemented a DistilBERT transformer model with a regression head, yielding substantial improvements with MAE of 0.66 and positive $R^2$. This enabled Cycle 5's adaptive feedback implementation, which demonstrated statistically significant score improvements (mean +0.060 bands, p = 0.011, Cohen's d = 0.504), though effectiveness varied by revision strategy. Findings suggest automated feedback functions are most suited as a supplement to human instruction, with conservative surface-level corrections proving more reliable than aggressive structural interventions for IELTS preparation contexts. Challenges remain in assessing higher-band essays, and future work should incorporate longitudinal studies with real IELTS candidates and validation from official examiners.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 该论文提出将段落分割作为语音转录后处理的关键步骤，创建了首个语音段落分割基准数据集，并开发了基于约束解码的LLM方法和紧凑模型MiniSeg，实现了段落和章节的联合预测。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 自动语音转录通常生成无结构的词流，降低了可读性和再利用价值。段落分割作为缺失的结构化步骤，在语音处理和文本分割领域都缺乏专门的基准和方法。

Method: 1) 创建TEDPara（人工标注TED演讲）和YTSegPara（合成标签YouTube视频）基准数据集；2) 提出约束解码方法，让大语言模型插入段落分隔符同时保留原始转录文本；3) 开发紧凑模型MiniSeg，并通过层次化扩展实现章节和段落的联合预测。

Result: 建立了首个语音段落分割基准，提出的约束解码方法实现了忠实、句子对齐的评估，MiniSeg模型在准确性和计算效率方面达到最先进水平，并能以最小计算成本联合预测章节和段落。

Conclusion: 该研究的资源和方将段落分割确立为语音处理中标准化、实用的任务，填补了语音转录后处理的关键空白，并为更广泛的文本分割领域提供了自然主义的基准。

Abstract: Automatic speech transcripts are often delivered as unstructured word streams that impede readability and repurposing. We recast paragraph segmentation as the missing structuring step and fill three gaps at the intersection of speech processing and text segmentation. First, we establish TEDPara (human-annotated TED talks) and YTSegPara (YouTube videos with synthetic labels) as the first benchmarks for the paragraph segmentation task. The benchmarks focus on the underexplored speech domain, where paragraph segmentation has traditionally not been part of post-processing, while also contributing to the wider text segmentation field, which still lacks robust and naturalistic benchmarks. Second, we propose a constrained-decoding formulation that lets large language models insert paragraph breaks while preserving the original transcript, enabling faithful, sentence-aligned evaluation. Third, we show that a compact model (MiniSeg) attains state-of-the-art accuracy and, when extended hierarchically, jointly predicts chapters and paragraphs with minimal computational cost. Together, our resources and methods establish paragraph segmentation as a standardized, practical task in speech processing.

TL;DR: KCL是一个评估语言模型法律推理能力的基准，通过提供问题级支持判例来分离推理能力与领域知识，包含多项选择和开放式生成两个组件。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有法律基准难以区分语言模型的推理能力与参数化知识，需要开发能够更忠实分离这两种能力的评估工具。

Method: 构建韩国典型法律基准(KCL)，包含KCL-MCQA（283个多项选择题，1,103个对齐判例）和KCL-Essay（169个开放式问题，550个对齐判例，2,739个实例级评分标准）。提供问题级支持判例以实现推理能力与知识的解耦。

Result: 对30多个模型的系统评估显示存在较大差距，特别是在KCL-Essay上，专门用于推理的模型始终优于通用模型。

Conclusion: KCL基准能够有效评估语言模型的法律推理能力，揭示了当前模型的局限性，并提供了可用于进一步研究的完整资源。

Abstract: We introduce the Korean Canonical Legal Benchmark (KCL), a benchmark designed to assess language models' legal reasoning capabilities independently of domain-specific knowledge. KCL provides question-level supporting precedents, enabling a more faithful disentanglement of reasoning ability from parameterized knowledge. KCL consists of two components: (1) KCL-MCQA, multiple-choice problems of 283 questions with 1,103 aligned precedents, and (2) KCL-Essay, open-ended generation problems of 169 questions with 550 aligned precedents and 2,739 instance-level rubrics for automated evaluation. Our systematic evaluation of 30+ models shows large remaining gaps, particularly in KCL-Essay, and that reasoning-specialized models consistently outperform their general-purpose counterparts.

TL;DR: CREST是一种无需训练的方法，通过干预注意力头来引导LLM推理轨迹，提高准确率同时减少计算成本


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型依赖长链式思维推理，但推理轨迹常低效且不稳定，导致高延迟和推理质量波动

Method: CREST包含离线校准（识别认知头并推导特定向量）和推理时程序（旋转隐藏表示以抑制低效推理行为）

Result: 在多样化推理基准测试中，CREST将准确率提升高达17.5%，同时减少37.6%的token使用量

Conclusion: CREST提供了一种简单有效的途径，实现更快、更可靠的LLM推理，无需额外训练

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) often rely on long chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning to solve complex tasks. While effective, these trajectories are frequently inefficient, leading to high latency from excessive token generation, or unstable reasoning that alternates between underthinking (shallow, inconsistent steps) and overthinking (repetitive, verbose reasoning). In this work, we study the structure of reasoning trajectories and uncover specialized attention heads that correlate with distinct cognitive behaviors such as verification and backtracking. By lightly intervening on these heads at inference time, we can steer the model away from inefficient modes. Building on this insight, we propose CREST, a training-free method for Cognitive REasoning Steering at Test-time. CREST has two components: (1) an offline calibration step that identifies cognitive heads and derives head-specific steering vectors, and (2) an inference-time procedure that rotates hidden representations to suppress components along those vectors. CREST adaptively suppresses unproductive reasoning behaviors, yielding both higher accuracy and lower computational cost. Across diverse reasoning benchmarks and models, CREST improves accuracy by up to 17.5% while reducing token usage by 37.6%, offering a simple and effective pathway to faster, more reliable LLM reasoning.

TL;DR: Youtu-LLM是一个1.96B参数的轻量级语言模型，通过从头预训练而非蒸馏，在紧凑架构下实现了128k长上下文支持，并通过"常识-STEM-智能体"课程训练策略，在子20亿参数模型中达到了SOTA性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前轻量级模型通常依赖蒸馏技术，缺乏原生智能体能力。研究旨在开发一个既高效又具备内在推理和规划能力的轻量级模型，证明小型模型也能拥有强大的智能体能力。

Method: 1. 采用密集多潜在注意力(MLA)架构和STEM导向词表，支持128k上下文窗口；2. 设计"常识-STEM-智能体"课程训练策略，使用约11T token的多阶段训练数据；3. 通过多样化数据构建方案进行智能体中训练，合成数学、编码和工具使用领域的轨迹。

Result: Youtu-LLM在子20亿参数模型中达到新的SOTA：在通用基准测试中与更大模型竞争，在智能体特定任务上显著超越现有SOTA基线，证明轻量级模型可具备强大的内在智能体能力。

Conclusion: 通过系统化的架构设计和训练策略，轻量级模型可以实现高性能的智能体能力，为高效AI智能体部署提供了新方向。

Abstract: We introduce Youtu-LLM, a lightweight yet powerful language model that harmonizes high computational efficiency with native agentic intelligence. Unlike typical small models that rely on distillation, Youtu-LLM (1.96B) is pre-trained from scratch to systematically cultivate reasoning and planning capabilities. The key technical advancements are as follows: (1) Compact Architecture with Long-Context Support: Built on a dense Multi-Latent Attention (MLA) architecture with a novel STEM-oriented vocabulary, Youtu-LLM supports a 128k context window. This design enables robust long-context reasoning and state tracking within a minimal memory footprint, making it ideal for long-horizon agent and reasoning tasks. (2) Principled "Commonsense-STEM-Agent" Curriculum: We curated a massive corpus of approximately 11T tokens and implemented a multi-stage training strategy. By progressively shifting the pre-training data distribution from general commonsense to complex STEM and agentic tasks, we ensure the model acquires deep cognitive abilities rather than superficial alignment. (3) Scalable Agentic Mid-training: Specifically for the agentic mid-training, we employ diverse data construction schemes to synthesize rich and varied trajectories across math, coding, and tool-use domains. This high-quality data enables the model to internalize planning and reflection behaviors effectively. Extensive evaluations show that Youtu-LLM sets a new state-of-the-art for sub-2B LLMs. On general benchmarks, it achieves competitive performance against larger models, while on agent-specific tasks, it significantly surpasses existing SOTA baselines, demonstrating that lightweight models can possess strong intrinsic agentic capabilities.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: MUSIC是一种无监督数据增强策略，通过合成跨多轮对话的对比对话对来训练更稳健的多轮奖励模型，在保持单轮基准性能的同时提升多轮对话评估质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 评估多轮对话质量对LLM发展至关重要但具有挑战性，通常需要昂贵的人工评估。现有标准偏好数据集仅基于最终轮次进行对比，无法充分捕捉多轮交互的细微差别，导致多轮奖励模型训练信号不足。

Method: 提出MUSIC（多步指令对比）无监督数据增强策略，通过合成跨越多轮对话的对比对话对，创建包含多轮差异的训练数据。基于Skywork偏好数据集，在Gemma-2-9B-Instruct模型上训练多轮奖励模型。

Result: MUSIC增强的奖励模型在性能上超越基线方法，在多轮对话评估中与先进专有LLM评判结果更一致，且不损害标准单轮奖励模型基准性能。

Conclusion: 跨越多轮对话的对比对于构建稳健的多轮奖励模型至关重要，MUSIC策略能有效提升多轮对话评估质量，为LLM训练提供更可扩展的评估方案。

Abstract: Evaluating the quality of multi-turn conversations is crucial for developing capable Large Language Models (LLMs), yet remains a significant challenge, often requiring costly human evaluation. Multi-turn reward models (RMs) offer a scalable alternative and can provide valuable signals for guiding LLM training. While recent work has advanced multi-turn \textit{training} techniques, effective automated \textit{evaluation} specifically for multi-turn interactions lags behind. We observe that standard preference datasets, typically contrasting responses based only on the final conversational turn, provide insufficient signal to capture the nuances of multi-turn interactions. Instead, we find that incorporating contrasts spanning \textit{multiple} turns is critical for building robust multi-turn RMs. Motivated by this finding, we propose \textbf{MU}lti-\textbf{S}tep \textbf{I}nstruction \textbf{C}ontrast (MUSIC), an unsupervised data augmentation strategy that synthesizes contrastive conversation pairs exhibiting differences across multiple turns. Leveraging MUSIC on the Skywork preference dataset, we train a multi-turn RM based on the Gemma-2-9B-Instruct model. Empirical results demonstrate that our MUSIC-augmented RM outperforms baseline methods, achieving higher alignment with judgments from advanced proprietary LLM judges on multi-turn conversations, crucially, without compromising performance on standard single-turn RM benchmarks.

TL;DR: BIOME-Bench：用于评估LLM在多组学分析中生物分子相互作用推断和通路机制阐明能力的标准化基准


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前多组学研究依赖通路富集分析，但该方法受限于通路资源的结构性问题（如更新滞后、功能冗余、对分子状态和干预的敏感性有限）。虽然已有研究探索使用LLM改进通路富集分析，但缺乏标准化的端到端多组学通路机制阐明基准，阻碍了可重复性进展。

Method: 提出BIOME-Bench基准，通过四阶段工作流程构建，用于评估LLM在多组学分析中的两个核心能力：1) 生物分子相互作用推断；2) 端到端多组学通路机制阐明。开发了两种任务的评估协议，并在多个当代强模型上进行全面实验。

Result: 实验结果表明，现有模型在多组学分析中仍存在显著缺陷：难以可靠地区分细粒度的生物分子关系类型，也无法生成忠实、稳健的通路水平机制解释。

Conclusion: BIOME-Bench为评估和改进LLM在多组学分析中的能力提供了标准化基准，揭示了当前模型在生物分子相互作用推断和通路机制阐明方面的局限性，为未来研究指明了方向。

Abstract: Multi-omics studies often rely on pathway enrichment to interpret heterogeneous molecular changes, but pathway enrichment (PE)-based workflows inherit structural limitations of pathway resources, including curation lag, functional redundancy, and limited sensitivity to molecular states and interventions. Although recent work has explored using large language models (LLMs) to improve PE-based interpretation, the lack of a standardized benchmark for end-to-end multi-omics pathway mechanism elucidation has largely confined evaluation to small, manually curated datasets or ad hoc case studies, hindering reproducible progress. To address this issue, we introduce BIOME-Bench, constructed via a rigorous four-stage workflow, to evaluate two core capabilities of LLMs in multi-omics analysis: Biomolecular Interaction Inference and end-to-end Multi-Omics Pathway Mechanism Elucidation. We develop evaluation protocols for both tasks and conduct comprehensive experiments across multiple strong contemporary models. Experimental results demonstrate that existing models still exhibit substantial deficiencies in multi-omics analysis, struggling to reliably distinguish fine-grained biomolecular relation types and to generate faithful, robust pathway-level mechanistic explanations.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前文献往往忽视生成长推理序列所带来的显著计算负担。在工业应用中，模型选择不仅取决于原始准确性，还受到资源约束和推理成本的影响。因此需要从计算效率角度评估LLMs的性能表现。

Method: 采用测试时计算感知的评估方法，对当代和早期开源LLMs进行系统评估，绘制它们在数学和推理密集型基准测试中的帕累托前沿。分析专家混合架构的表现，并追踪帕累托效率随时间的变化轨迹。

Result: 研究发现专家混合架构在评估设置中能够很好地平衡性能与效率。通过追踪帕累托效率的时间轨迹，得出了关于每单位计算精度增益的涌现趋势。同时证明了推理计算存在饱和点，超过特定阈值后精度增益会递减。

Conclusion: 虽然扩展推理能力是有益的，但无法克服模型在特定复杂性方面的内在限制。专家混合架构在性能与效率权衡方面表现出色，为工业应用中的模型选择提供了重要参考。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are demonstrating rapid improvements on complex reasoning benchmarks, particularly when allowed to utilize intermediate reasoning steps before converging on a final solution. However, current literature often overlooks the significant computational burden associated with generating long reasoning sequences. For industrial applications, model selection depends not only on raw accuracy but also on resource constraints and inference costs. In this work, we conduct a test-time-compute aware evaluation of both contemporary and older open-source LLMs, mapping their Pareto frontiers across math- and reasoning-intensive benchmarks. Our findings identify the Mixture of Experts (MoE) architecture as a strong candidate to balance performance and efficiency in our evaluation setting. Furthermore, we trace the trajectory of Pareto efficiency over time to derive an emergent trend regarding accuracy gain per unit of compute. Finally, we demonstrate that there is a saturation point for inference-time compute. Beyond a certain threshold, accuracy gains diminish, indicating that while extended reasoning capabilities are beneficial, they cannot overcome intrinsic model limitations regarding specific complexities.

Abstract: As Natural Language Processing (NLP) systems become more pervasive, integrating ethical considerations into NLP education has become essential. However, this presents inherent challenges in curriculum development: the field's rapid evolution from both academia and industry, and the need to foster critical thinking beyond traditional technical training. We introduce our course on Ethical Aspects in NLP and our pedagogical approach, grounded in active learning through interactive sessions, hands-on activities, and "learning by teaching" methods. Over four years, the course has been refined and adapted across different institutions, educational levels, and interdisciplinary backgrounds; it has also yielded many reusable products, both in the form of teaching materials and in the form of actual educational products aimed at diverse audiences, made by the students themselves. By sharing our approach and experience, we hope to provide inspiration for educators seeking to incorporate social impact considerations into their curricula.

TL;DR: 提出因果三角验证方法，用于在多语言环境中验证语言模型的机制解释，要求电路在保持语义的变体上具有必要性、充分性和不变性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多语言语言模型在整体性能上表现良好，但在不同语言、文字和文化间的行为不可预测。现有机制解释缺乏因果标准，无法在保持语义但改变表面形式的变体中进行验证。

Method: 提出"三角验证"方法：1)定义"参考族"作为保持谓词的变体；2)要求电路满足必要性（消融电路会降低目标行为）、充分性（修补激活能转移行为）和不变性（在参考族中效应保持方向稳定和足够幅度）；3)结合自动电路发现，通过三角验证接受或拒绝候选电路。

Result: 三角验证提供了可证伪的机制解释标准，能够过滤掉通过单环境测试但在跨语言不变性上失败的虚假电路。该方法基于因果抽象理论，通过分布交换干预的近似变换分数实现。

Conclusion: 三角验证为机制解释建立了严格的因果标准，确保解释在不同语言环境中保持稳健，推动了实用可解释性议程的发展。

Abstract: Multilingual language models achieve strong aggregate performance yet often behave unpredictably across languages, scripts, and cultures. We argue that mechanistic explanations for such models should satisfy a \emph{causal} standard: claims must survive causal interventions and must \emph{cross-reference} across environments that perturb surface form while preserving meaning. We formalize \emph{reference families} as predicate-preserving variants and introduce \emph{triangulation}, an acceptance rule requiring necessity (ablating the circuit degrades the target behavior), sufficiency (patching activations transfers the behavior), and invariance (both effects remain directionally stable and of sufficient magnitude across the reference family). To supply candidate subgraphs, we adopt automatic circuit discovery and \emph{accept or reject} those candidates by triangulation. We ground triangulation in causal abstraction by casting it as an approximate transformation score over a distribution of interchange interventions, connect it to the pragmatic interpretability agenda, and present a comparative experimental protocol across multiple model families, language pairs, and tasks. Triangulation provides a falsifiable standard for mechanistic claims that filters spurious circuits passing single-environment tests but failing cross-lingual invariance.

TL;DR: Encyclo-K是一个基于知识陈述的基准测试框架，通过从权威教科书中提取独立知识陈述，并在测试时动态组合成评估问题，解决了现有基准测试的三个主要限制。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基准测试存在三个根本性限制：1) 容易受到数据污染的影响；2) 仅限于单知识点评估；3) 依赖昂贵的领域专家标注。需要一种新的基准构建方法来克服这些缺陷。

Method: 从权威教科书中提取独立的知识陈述作为基本单位，在测试时通过随机抽样动态组合成评估问题。每个问题聚合8-10个陈述进行多知识综合评估，标注者只需验证格式合规性而不需要领域专业知识。

Result: 在50多个LLM上的实验表明，Encyclo-K具有强大的区分能力。即使是表现最好的OpenAI-GPT-5.1也只有62.07%的准确率。推理模型准确率在16.04%到62.07%之间，聊天模型在9.71%到50.40%之间，显示出清晰的梯度分布。

Conclusion: Encyclo-K成功解决了现有基准测试的三个限制，通过动态评估和多陈述综合理解引入了实质性挑战，建立了一个可扩展的框架用于评估LLM对多个细粒度学科知识陈述的综合理解能力。

Abstract: Benchmarks play a crucial role in tracking the rapid advancement of large language models (LLMs) and identifying their capability boundaries. However, existing benchmarks predominantly curate questions at the question level, suffering from three fundamental limitations: vulnerability to data contamination, restriction to single-knowledge-point assessment, and reliance on costly domain expert annotation. We propose Encyclo-K, a statement-based benchmark that rethinks benchmark construction from the ground up. Our key insight is that knowledge statements, not questions, can serve as the unit of curation, and questions can then be constructed from them. We extract standalone knowledge statements from authoritative textbooks and dynamically compose them into evaluation questions through random sampling at test time. This design directly addresses all three limitations: the combinatorial space is too vast to memorize, and model rankings remain stable across dynamically generated question sets, enabling reliable periodic dataset refresh; each question aggregates 8-10 statements for comprehensive multi-knowledge assessment; annotators only verify formatting compliance without requiring domain expertise, substantially reducing annotation costs. Experiments on over 50 LLMs demonstrate that Encyclo-K poses substantial challenges with strong discriminative power. Even the top-performing OpenAI-GPT-5.1 achieves only 62.07% accuracy, and model performance displays a clear gradient distribution--reasoning models span from 16.04% to 62.07%, while chat models range from 9.71% to 50.40%. These results validate the challenges introduced by dynamic evaluation and multi-statement comprehensive understanding. These findings establish Encyclo-K as a scalable framework for dynamic evaluation of LLMs' comprehensive understanding over multiple fine-grained disciplinary knowledge statements.

TL;DR: mHC框架通过将超连接的残差连接空间投影到特定流形上，恢复身份映射特性，解决训练不稳定性和可扩展性限制问题


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 超连接等研究扩展了残差连接范式，但破坏了身份映射特性，导致训练不稳定、可扩展性受限和内存访问开销增加

Method: 提出流形约束超连接框架，将超连接的残差连接空间投影到特定流形上以恢复身份映射特性，并进行严格的基础设施优化确保效率

Result: mHC在规模化训练中有效，提供实质性性能改进和优越的可扩展性

Conclusion: mHC作为超连接的灵活实用扩展，有助于深入理解拓扑架构设计，为基础模型的演进指明方向

Abstract: Recently, studies exemplified by Hyper-Connections (HC) have extended the ubiquitous residual connection paradigm established over the past decade by expanding the residual stream width and diversifying connectivity patterns. While yielding substantial performance gains, this diversification fundamentally compromises the identity mapping property intrinsic to the residual connection, which causes severe training instability and restricted scalability, and additionally incurs notable memory access overhead. To address these challenges, we propose Manifold-Constrained Hyper-Connections (mHC), a general framework that projects the residual connection space of HC onto a specific manifold to restore the identity mapping property, while incorporating rigorous infrastructure optimization to ensure efficiency. Empirical experiments demonstrate that mHC is effective for training at scale, offering tangible performance improvements and superior scalability. We anticipate that mHC, as a flexible and practical extension of HC, will contribute to a deeper understanding of topological architecture design and suggest promising directions for the evolution of foundational models.

TL;DR: BEDA框架通过将信念估计转化为生成约束，为战略对话提供了一种简单通用的机制，在对抗、合作和谈判三种设置中均优于基线方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有战略对话研究虽然能准确估计信念，但缺乏使用这些信念进行生成的机制。本文旨在填补这一空白，通过将信念估计转化为生成约束来指导对话行为。

Method: 首先形式化了对抗和协调两种核心对话行为，然后通过概率约束操作化这些行为。提出了BEDA框架，包含世界集合、信念估计器和条件生成器三个组件，后者根据推断的信念选择行为并生成一致的语句。

Result: 在三种设置中均取得显著改进：在CKBG（对抗）中，成功率至少提高5.0个百分点（GPT-4.1-nano提高20.6个百分点）；在Mutual Friends（合作）中平均提高9.3个百分点；在CaSiNo（谈判）中实现了相对于所有基线的最优交易。

Conclusion: 将信念估计作为约束条件为可靠的战略对话提供了一个简单而通用的机制，BEDA框架在多种对话场景中表现出色。

Abstract: Strategic dialogue requires agents to execute distinct dialogue acts, for which belief estimation is essential. While prior work often estimates beliefs accurately, it lacks a principled mechanism to use those beliefs during generation. We bridge this gap by first formalizing two core acts Adversarial and Alignment, and by operationalizing them via probabilistic constraints on what an agent may generate. We instantiate this idea in BEDA, a framework that consists of the world set, the belief estimator for belief estimation, and the conditional generator that selects acts and realizes utterances consistent with the inferred beliefs. Across three settings, Conditional Keeper Burglar (CKBG, adversarial), Mutual Friends (MF, cooperative), and CaSiNo (negotiation), BEDA consistently outperforms strong baselines: on CKBG it improves success rate by at least 5.0 points across backbones and by 20.6 points with GPT-4.1-nano; on Mutual Friends it achieves an average improvement of 9.3 points; and on CaSiNo it achieves the optimal deal relative to all baselines. These results indicate that casting belief estimation as constraints provides a simple, general mechanism for reliable strategic dialogue.

TL;DR: ADOPT是一个用于多步LLM管道的自适应依赖感知提示优化框架，通过显式建模步骤间依赖关系实现精确的文本梯度估计，优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多步LLM管道性能严重依赖各步骤提示，但由于缺乏步骤级监督和步骤间依赖关系，联合优化这些提示非常困难。现有端到端提示优化方法在这些条件下效果不佳，往往产生次优或不稳定的更新。

Method: ADOPT框架显式建模每个LLM步骤与最终任务结果之间的依赖关系，实现类似计算解析导数的精确文本梯度估计。它将文本梯度估计与梯度更新解耦，将多提示优化简化为灵活的单提示优化步骤，并采用基于Shapley值的机制自适应分配优化资源。

Result: 在真实世界数据集和多样化管道结构上的实验表明，ADOPT是有效且鲁棒的，在性能上持续优于最先进的提示优化基线方法。

Conclusion: ADOPT通过显式建模步骤间依赖关系、解耦梯度估计与更新、自适应资源分配，成功解决了多步LLM管道中提示优化的挑战，为复杂任务提供了有效的优化框架。

Abstract: Multi-step LLM pipelines invoke large language models multiple times in a structured sequence and can effectively solve complex tasks, but their performance heavily depends on the prompts used at each step. Jointly optimizing these prompts is difficult due to missing step-level supervision and inter-step dependencies. Existing end-to-end prompt optimization methods struggle under these conditions and often yield suboptimal or unstable updates. We propose ADOPT, an Adaptive Dependency-aware Prompt Optimization framework for multi-step LLM pipelines. ADOPT explicitly models the dependency between each LLM step and the final task outcome, enabling precise text-gradient estimation analogous to computing analytical derivatives. It decouples textual gradient estimation from gradient updates, reducing multi-prompt optimization to flexible single-prompt optimization steps, and employs a Shapley-based mechanism to adaptively allocate optimization resources. Experiments on real-world datasets and diverse pipeline structures show that ADOPT is effective and robust, consistently outperforming state-of-the-art prompt optimization baselines.

*Nasim Borazjanizadeh,James McClelland*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Thought Gestalt模型是一种双层次Transformer，通过同时建模token和句子级"思想"状态来提升语言模型的全局一致性和数据效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统Transformer主要依赖表面共现统计，缺乏对实体和事件的全局一致潜在表示，导致关系方向脆弱性、上下文错误和数据效率低下。受认知科学启发，人类理解语言时会将其转换为紧凑的事件式表示，而字面形式记忆短暂。

Method: 提出Thought Gestalt模型，一种循环Transformer，在两个抽象层次上建模语言：token和句子级"思想"状态。模型逐句生成token，同时交叉关注先前句子表示的记忆。token和句子表示使用相同参数集生成，通过单一目标（下一个token交叉熵）训练，通过保留写入记忆的句子表示计算图，使未来token损失的梯度通过交叉注意力反向传播优化早期句子向量生成参数。

Result: 在扩展实验中，TG相比匹配的GPT-2运行持续提升效率，扩展拟合表明GPT-2需要约5-8%更多数据和33-42%更多参数才能达到TG的损失水平。TG在父子反转诅咒探针上减少了关系方向泛化错误。

Conclusion: Thought Gestalt模型通过引入句子级抽象表示，模仿人类认知过程，有效提升了语言模型的全局一致性、数据效率和关系方向泛化能力，为构建更鲁棒的语言理解系统提供了新方向。

Abstract: Transformer language models can generate strikingly natural text by modeling language as a sequence of tokens. Yet, by relying primarily on surface-level co-occurrence statistics, they fail to form globally consistent latent representations of entities and events, lack of which contributes to brittleness in relational direction (e.g., reversal curse), contextualization errors, and data inefficiency. On the other hand, cognitive science shows that human comprehension involves converting the input linguistic stream into compact, event-like representations that persist in memory while verbatim form is short-lived. Motivated by this view, we introduce Thought Gestalt (TG) model, a recurrent Transformer that models language at two levels of abstraction - tokens and sentence-level "thought" states. TG generates the tokens of one sentence at a time while cross-attending to a memory of prior sentence representations. In TG, token and sentence representations are generated using the same set of model parameters and trained with a single objective, the next-token cross-entropy: by retaining the computation graph of sentence representations written to memory, gradients from future token losses flow backward through cross-attention to optimize the parameters generating earlier sentence vectors. In scaling experiments, TG consistently improves efficiency over matched GPT-2 runs, among other baselines, with scaling fits indicating GPT-2 requires ~5-8% more data and ~33-42% more parameters to match TG's loss. TG also reduces errors on relational direction generalization on a father-son reversal curse probe.

*Chao Peng,Bin Wang,Zhilei Long,Jinfang Sheng*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: AdaGReS是一个用于检索增强生成(RAG)的冗余感知上下文选择框架，通过结合查询-块相关性和集合内冗余惩罚的集合级目标，在token预算约束下进行贪婪选择，无需手动调参即可优化上下文质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 标准top-k检索在RAG中经常返回冗余或近似重复的文本块，这会浪费token预算并降低下游生成质量。现有方法缺乏对冗余的系统性控制，且需要手动调整相关性与冗余之间的权衡参数。

Method: 提出AdaGReS框架：1) 定义集合级目标函数，结合查询-块相关性和集合内冗余惩罚；2) 在token预算约束下使用边际增益进行贪婪选择；3) 引入闭式、实例自适应的校准方法，根据候选池统计和预算限制自动调整相关性与冗余的权衡参数；4) 提供理论分析证明目标函数在实用嵌入相似性条件下具有epsilon-近似子模性，为贪婪选择提供近似最优性保证。

Result: 在开放域问答(Natural Questions)和高冗余生物医学(药物)语料库上的实验表明，AdaGReS在冗余控制和上下文质量方面持续改进，转化为更好的端到端答案质量和跨设置的鲁棒性。

Conclusion: AdaGReS通过系统性地优化相关性与冗余的权衡，在token预算约束下实现了更有效的上下文选择，无需手动调参，为RAG系统提供了理论保证的实用解决方案。

Abstract: Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) is highly sensitive to the quality of selected context, yet standard top-k retrieval often returns redundant or near-duplicate chunks that waste token budget and degrade downstream generation. We present AdaGReS, a redundancy-aware context selection framework for token-budgeted RAG that optimizes a set-level objective combining query-chunk relevance and intra-set redundancy penalties. AdaGReS performs greedy selection under a token-budget constraint using marginal gains derived from the objective, and introduces a closed-form, instance-adaptive calibration of the relevance-redundancy trade-off parameter to eliminate manual tuning and adapt to candidate-pool statistics and budget limits. We further provide a theoretical analysis showing that the proposed objective exhibits epsilon-approximate submodularity under practical embedding similarity conditions, yielding near-optimality guarantees for greedy selection. Experiments on open-domain question answering (Natural Questions) and a high-redundancy biomedical (drug) corpus demonstrate consistent improvements in redundancy control and context quality, translating to better end-to-end answer quality and robustness across settings.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有文本驱动的3D人体运动编辑方法虽然取得了显著进展，但由于其全局建模特性，难以精确控制细节化的、特定部位的运动

Method: 1. 部件感知运动调制（PMM）模块：基于预定义的五部分身体分解，动态预测每个身体部件的时间变化调制权重；2. 部件级相似度曲线监督机制：采用双层归一化增强，指导PMM学习语义一致且可编辑的分布；3. 双向运动交互（BMI）模块：利用双向跨模态注意力实现文本指令与运动语义的精确对齐

Result: 在知名基准测试上的广泛定量和定性评估表明，PartMotionEdit优于现有最先进方法

Conclusion: PartMotionEdit通过部件级语义调制实现了细粒度、精确可控的3D人体运动编辑，解决了现有方法在局部运动控制方面的局限性

Abstract: Existing text-driven 3D human motion editing methods have demonstrated significant progress, but are still difficult to precisely control over detailed, part-specific motions due to their global modeling nature. In this paper, we propose PartMotionEdit, a novel fine-grained motion editing framework that operates via part-level semantic modulation. The core of PartMotionEdit is a Part-aware Motion Modulation (PMM) module, which builds upon a predefined five-part body decomposition. PMM dynamically predicts time-varying modulation weights for each body part, enabling precise and interpretable editing of local motions. To guide the training of PMM, we also introduce a part-level similarity curve supervision mechanism enhanced with dual-layer normalization. This mechanism assists PMM in learning semantically consistent and editable distributions across all body parts. Furthermore, we design a Bidirectional Motion Interaction (BMI) module. It leverages bidirectional cross-modal attention to achieve more accurate semantic alignment between textual instructions and motion semantics. Extensive quantitative and qualitative evaluations on a well-known benchmark demonstrate that PartMotionEdit outperforms the state-of-the-art methods.

### [134] [The Drill-Down and Fabricate Test (DDFT): A Protocol for Measuring Epistemic Robustness in Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.23850)
*Rahul Baxi*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 论文提出DDFT协议评估语言模型的认知稳健性，发现模型规模与稳健性无关，错误检测能力是关键瓶颈


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前语言模型评估主要测量理想条件下的知识掌握程度，但无法评估在现实压力下（如信息退化或对抗性攻击时）的知识稳健性。静态基准测试无法区分模型是缺乏知识还是验证机制在压力下崩溃

Method: 提出DDFT（Drill-Down and Fabricate Test）协议，通过渐进语义压缩和对抗性伪造来测量认知稳健性。采用双系统认知模型：语义系统生成流畅文本，认知验证器验证事实准确性。评估了9个前沿模型在8个知识领域和5个压缩级别（共1800次轮级评估）

Result: 认知稳健性与传统设计范式正交：参数数量（r=0.083, p=0.832）和架构类型（r=0.153, p=0.695）均不显著预测稳健性。错误检测能力强烈预测整体稳健性（rho=-0.817, p=0.007）。旗舰模型尽管规模大但表现出脆弱性，而较小模型可实现稳健性能

Conclusion: 认知稳健性主要来自训练方法和验证机制，而非模型规模或架构。DDFT框架为关键应用部署前评估认知稳健性提供了理论基础和实用工具，挑战了模型规模与可靠性关系的传统假设

Abstract: Current language model evaluations measure what models know under ideal conditions but not how robustly they know it under realistic stress. Static benchmarks like MMLU and TruthfulQA cannot distinguish a model that lacks knowledge from one whose verification mechanisms collapse when information degrades or adversaries probe for weaknesses. We introduce the Drill-Down and Fabricate Test (DDFT), a protocol that measures epistemic robustness: a model's ability to maintain factual accuracy under progressive semantic compression and adversarial fabrication. We propose a two-system cognitive model comprising a Semantic System that generates fluent text and an Epistemic Verifier that validates factual accuracy. Our findings, based on evaluating 9 frontier models across 8 knowledge domains at 5 compression levels (1,800 turn-level evaluations), reveal that epistemic robustness is orthogonal to conventional design paradigms. Neither parameter count (r=0.083, p=0.832) nor architectural type (r=0.153, p=0.695) significantly predicts robustness, suggesting it emerges from training methodology and verification mechanisms distinct from current approaches. Error detection capability strongly predicts overall robustness (rho=-0.817, p=0.007), indicating this is the critical bottleneck. We find that flagship models exhibit brittleness despite their scale, while smaller models can achieve robust performance, challenging assumptions about the relationship between model size and reliability. The DDFT framework provides both theoretical foundation and practical tools for assessing epistemic robustness before deployment in critical applications.

Conclusion: McCoy框架通过结合LLMs和ASP，克服了符号AI在医疗领域应用的知识库构建障碍，为疾病诊断提供了一个强大且可解释的解决方案。

Abstract: Accurate disease prediction is vital for timely intervention, effective treatment, and reducing medical complications. While symbolic AI has been applied in healthcare, its adoption remains limited due to the effort required for constructing high-quality knowledge bases. This work introduces McCoy, a framework that combines Large Language Models (LLMs) with Answer Set Programming (ASP) to overcome this barrier. McCoy orchestrates an LLM to translate medical literature into ASP code, combines it with patient data, and processes it using an ASP solver to arrive at the final diagnosis. This integration yields a robust, interpretable prediction framework that leverages the strengths of both paradigms. Preliminary results show McCoy has strong performance on small-scale disease diagnosis tasks.

Conclusion: SPARK通过整合细粒度智能体专业化和协作检索，为能够捕捉人类信息寻求行为复杂性、流动性和上下文敏感性的下一代搜索系统提供了理论框架和实现路径。

Abstract: Personalized search demands the ability to model users' evolving, multi-dimensional information needs; a challenge for systems constrained by static profiles or monolithic retrieval pipelines. We present SPARK (Search Personalization via Agent-Driven Retrieval and Knowledge-sharing), a framework in which coordinated persona-based large language model (LLM) agents deliver task-specific retrieval and emergent personalization. SPARK formalizes a persona space defined by role, expertise, task context, and domain, and introduces a Persona Coordinator that dynamically interprets incoming queries to activate the most relevant specialized agents. Each agent executes an independent retrieval-augmented generation process, supported by dedicated long- and short-term memory stores and context-aware reasoning modules. Inter-agent collaboration is facilitated through structured communication protocols, including shared memory repositories, iterative debate, and relay-style knowledge transfer. Drawing on principles from cognitive architectures, multi-agent coordination theory, and information retrieval, SPARK models how emergent personalization properties arise from distributed agent behaviors governed by minimal coordination rules. The framework yields testable predictions regarding coordination efficiency, personalization quality, and cognitive load distribution, while incorporating adaptive learning mechanisms for continuous persona refinement. By integrating fine-grained agent specialization with cooperative retrieval, SPARK provides insights for next-generation search systems capable of capturing the complexity, fluidity, and context sensitivity of human information-seeking behavior.

TL;DR: ROAD是一种无需标注数据集的自动提示优化框架，通过多智能体架构将失败日志转化为决策树协议，在冷启动场景中实现高效优化。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有自动提示优化方法依赖大量标注数据集，但在实际软件工程中，冷启动阶段通常只有杂乱的生产日志和不断演化的失败模式，缺乏精炼的数据集。

Method: ROAD采用多智能体架构：分析器进行根因分析，优化器进行模式聚合，教练进行策略整合，将非结构化失败日志转化为结构化的决策树协议，将优化视为动态调试而非随机搜索。

Result: 在标准化学术基准和实际知识管理引擎中，ROAD仅需三次自动迭代即可将成功率从73.6%提升至79.2%，搜索准确率提升3.8%；在零售领域复杂推理任务中，相对基线提升约19%性能。

Conclusion: 模拟人类工程师的失败分析和修复循环为部署可靠LLM智能体提供了一种可行的、数据高效的替代方案，避免了资源密集的强化学习训练。

Abstract: Automatic Prompt Optimization (APO) has emerged as a critical technique for enhancing Large Language Model (LLM) performance, yet current state-of-the-art methods typically rely on large, labeled gold-standard development sets to compute fitness scores for evolutionary or Reinforcement Learning (RL) approaches. In real-world software engineering, however, such curated datasets are rarely available during the initial cold start of agent development, where engineers instead face messy production logs and evolving failure modes. We present ROAD (Reflective Optimization via Automated Debugging), a novel framework that bypasses the need for refined datasets by treating optimization as a dynamic debugging investigation rather than a stochastic search. Unlike traditional mutation strategies, ROAD utilizes a specialized multi-agent architecture, comprising an Analyzer for root-cause analysis, an Optimizer for pattern aggregation, and a Coach for strategy integration, to convert unstructured failure logs into robust, structured Decision Tree Protocols. We evaluated ROAD across both a standardized academic benchmark and a live production Knowledge Management engine. Experimental results demonstrate that ROAD is highly sample-efficient, achieving a 5.6 percent increase in success rate (73.6 percent to 79.2 percent) and a 3.8 percent increase in search accuracy within just three automated iterations. Furthermore, on complex reasoning tasks in the retail domain, ROAD improved agent performance by approximately 19 percent relative to the baseline. These findings suggest that mimicking the human engineering loop of failure analysis and patching offers a viable, data-efficient alternative to resource-intensive RL training for deploying reliable LLM agents.

Result: 在AlphaEvolve基准测试和Kaggle竞赛中，LoongFlow相比OpenEvolve、ShinkaEvolve等基线方法，进化效率提升高达60%，并能发现更优的解决方案。

Conclusion: LoongFlow代表了自主科学发现的重要进展，能够在减少计算开销的情况下生成专家级解决方案，为自进化智能体框架提供了新的方向。

Abstract: The transition from static Large Language Models (LLMs) to self-improving agents is hindered by the lack of structured reasoning in traditional evolutionary approaches. Existing methods often struggle with premature convergence and inefficient exploration in high-dimensional code spaces. To address these challenges, we introduce LoongFlow, a self-evolving agent framework that achieves state-of-the-art solution quality with significantly reduced computational costs. Unlike "blind" mutation operators, LoongFlow integrates LLMs into a cognitive "Plan-Execute-Summarize" (PES) paradigm, effectively mapping the evolutionary search to a reasoning-heavy process. To sustain long-term architectural coherence, we incorporate a hybrid evolutionary memory system. By synergizing Multi-Island models with MAP-Elites and adaptive Boltzmann selection, this system theoretically balances the exploration-exploitation trade-off, maintaining diverse behavioral niches to prevent optimization stagnation. We instantiate LoongFlow with a General Agent for algorithmic discovery and an ML Agent for pipeline optimization. Extensive evaluations on the AlphaEvolve benchmark and Kaggle competitions demonstrate that LoongFlow outperforms leading baselines (e.g., OpenEvolve, ShinkaEvolve) by up to 60% in evolutionary efficiency while discovering superior solutions. LoongFlow marks a substantial step forward in autonomous scientific discovery, enabling the generation of expert-level solutions with reduced computational overhead.

*Evgenii Rudakov,Jonathan Shock,Benjamin Ultan Cowley*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出一种无需训练的图基方法解决ARC-AGI-3交互推理任务，通过视觉帧处理与系统化状态空间探索，在基准测试中显著优于前沿LLM


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: ARC-AGI-3基准包含需要推理任务机制的游戏式任务，当前最先进的LLM无法可靠解决这些任务，需要新的方法来处理交互推理和状态跟踪

Method: 结合视觉帧处理与系统化状态空间探索：1) 将视觉帧分割为有意义组件；2) 基于视觉显著性优先选择动作；3) 维护探索状态和转移的有向图；4) 跟踪访问状态和测试动作，优先选择到未测试状态-动作对的最短路径

Result: 在ARC-AGI-3预览挑战中，该方法在6个游戏的52个关卡中解决了中位数30关，在私有排行榜上排名第3，显著优于前沿LLM智能体

Conclusion: 即使无需学习，显式的图结构探索也能作为交互推理的强大基线，强调了在稀疏反馈环境中系统化状态跟踪和动作优先级的重要性，这些是当前LLM难以捕捉任务动态的领域

Abstract: We present a training-free graph-based approach for solving interactive reasoning tasks in the ARC-AGI-3 benchmark. ARC-AGI-3 comprises game-like tasks where agents must infer task mechanics through limited interactions, and adapt to increasing complexity as levels progress. Success requires forming hypotheses, testing them, and tracking discovered mechanics. The benchmark has revealed that state-of-the-art LLMs are currently incapable of reliably solving these tasks. Our method combines vision-based frame processing with systematic state-space exploration using graph-structured representations. It segments visual frames into meaningful components, prioritizes actions based on visual salience, and maintains a directed graph of explored states and transitions. By tracking visited states and tested actions, the agent prioritizes actions that provide the shortest path to untested state-action pairs. On the ARC-AGI-3 Preview Challenge, this structured exploration strategy solves a median of 30 out of 52 levels across six games and ranks 3rd on the private leaderboard, substantially outperforming frontier LLM-based agents. These results demonstrate that explicit graph-structured exploration, even without learning, can serve as a strong baseline for interactive reasoning and underscore the importance of systematic state tracking and action prioritization in sparse-feedback environments where current LLMs fail to capture task dynamics. The code is open source and available at https://github.com/dolphin-in-a-coma/arc-agi-3-just-explore.

*Lijun Zhang,Lin Li,Wei Wei,Yajie Qi,Huizhong Song,Jun Wang,Yaodong Yang,Jiye Liang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出Risk-aware Stepwise Alignment (RSA)方法，通过嵌套风险度量将风险意识融入语言模型对齐过程，解决传统风险中性方法对罕见但灾难性有害行为的不足


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有安全对齐方法（如Safe RLHF和SACPO）通常采用风险中性范式，无法有效处理偏离参考策略带来的风险，且对罕见但潜在灾难性有害行为的鲁棒性有限

Method: 提出RSA方法，将安全对齐表述为token级别的风险感知约束策略优化问题，通过基于嵌套风险度量的逐步对齐过程实现token级别的策略更新

Result: 实验结果表明，该方法在保持高帮助性的同时确保强安全性，并显著抑制尾部风险（低概率但高影响的不安全响应）

Conclusion: RSA通过明确的风险意识设计，有效缓解了模型偏离参考策略的风险，并抑制了低概率高影响的有害行为，为语言模型安全对齐提供了更稳健的方法

Abstract: When fine-tuning pre-trained Language Models (LMs) to exhibit desired behaviors, maintaining control over risk is critical for ensuring both safety and trustworthiness. Most existing safety alignment methods, such as Safe RLHF and SACPO, typically operate under a risk-neutral paradigm that is insufficient to address the risks arising from deviations from the reference policy and offers limited robustness against rare but potentially catastrophic harmful behaviors. To address this limitation, we propose Risk-aware Stepwise Alignment (RSA), a novel alignment method that explicitly incorporates risk awareness into the policy optimization process by leveraging a class of nested risk measures. Specifically, RSA formulates safety alignment as a token-level risk-aware constrained policy optimization problem and solves it through a stepwise alignment procedure that yields token-level policy updates derived from the nested risk measures. This design offers two key benefits: (1) it mitigates risks induced by excessive model shift away from a reference policy, and (2) it explicitly suppresses low-probability yet high-impact harmful behaviors. Moreover, we provide theoretical analysis on policy optimality under mild assumptions. Experimental results demonstrate that our method achieves high levels of helpfulness while ensuring strong safety and significantly suppresses tail risks, namely low-probability yet high-impact unsafe responses.

Abstract: A long-standing challenge in AI is to develop agents capable of solving a wide range of physical tasks and generalizing to new, unseen tasks and environments. A popular recent approach involves training a world model from state-action trajectories and subsequently use it with a planning algorithm to solve new tasks. Planning is commonly performed in the input space, but a recent family of methods has introduced planning algorithms that optimize in the learned representation space of the world model, with the promise that abstracting irrelevant details yields more efficient planning. In this work, we characterize models from this family as JEPA-WMs and investigate the technical choices that make algorithms from this class work. We propose a comprehensive study of several key components with the objective of finding the optimal approach within the family. We conducted experiments using both simulated environments and real-world robotic data, and studied how the model architecture, the training objective, and the planning algorithm affect planning success. We combine our findings to propose a model that outperforms two established baselines, DINO-WM and V-JEPA-2-AC, in both navigation and manipulation tasks.

TL;DR: 该研究评估了三种主流大语言模型（GPT-4o-mini、Gemini-2.0-Flash、DeepSeek-V3）在代表性不足的数学竞赛问题（密苏里大学数学竞赛）上的表现，发现DeepSeek-V3在微积分、解析几何和离散数学三个领域表现最佳，所有模型在几何问题上表现均较弱。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究大多使用相同的数据集评估大语言模型的数学推理能力，这限制了研究结果的普适性，可能无法全面捕捉数学任务中的多样化挑战。本研究旨在通过分析大语言模型在代表性不足的数学竞赛问题上的表现，更深入地了解其能力局限。

Method: 使用密苏里大学数学竞赛中的微积分、解析几何和离散数学问题，对GPT-4o-mini、Gemini-2.0-Flash和DeepSeek-V3三种大语言模型进行测试。将模型回答与已知正确答案进行比较以确定准确性，并分析模型的推理过程以探索不同问题类型和模型间的错误模式。

Result: DeepSeek-V3在微积分、解析几何和离散数学三个类别中表现最佳，无论是推理过程还是最终答案准确性都优于其他模型。所有三种大语言模型在几何问题上都表现出明显弱点。DeepSeek-V3的主要错误源于计算和逻辑错误，GPT-4o-mini经常出现逻辑和方法相关错误，而Gemini则倾向于不完整推理和仓促得出结论。

Conclusion: 在代表性不足的数学竞赛数据集上评估大语言模型，能够更深入地揭示其独特的错误模式，并突显结构化推理方面的持续挑战，特别是在几何领域。这种评估方法有助于更全面地理解大语言模型的数学推理能力局限。

Abstract: Understanding the limitations of Large Language Models, or LLMs, in mathematical reasoning has been the focus of several recent studies. However, the majority of these studies use the same datasets for benchmarking, which limits the generalizability of their findings and may not fully capture the diverse challenges present in mathematical tasks. The purpose of the present study is to analyze the performance of LLMs on underrepresented mathematics competition problems. We prompted three leading LLMs, namely GPT-4o-mini, Gemini-2.0-Flash, and DeepSeek-V3, with the Missouri Collegiate Mathematics Competition problems in the areas of Calculus, Analytic Geometry, and Discrete Mathematics. The LLMs responses were then compared to the known correct solutions in order to determine the accuracy of the LLM for each problem domain. We also analyzed the LLMs reasoning to explore patterns in errors across problem types and models. DeepSeek-V3 has the best performance in all three categories of Calculus, Analytic Geometry, and Discrete Mathematics, both in reasoning and correct final answers. All three LLMs exhibited notably weak performance in Geometry. The majority of errors made by DeepSeek-V3 were attributed to computational and logical mistakes, whereas GPT-4o-mini frequently exhibited logical and approach-related errors. Gemini, on the other hand, tended to struggle with incomplete reasoning and drawing rushed conclusions. In conclusion, evaluating LLMs on underrepresented mathematics competition datasets can provide deeper insights into their distinct error patterns and highlight ongoing challenges in structured reasoning, particularly within the domain of Geometry.

TL;DR: 提出两阶段方法分解空间推理：先通过监督微调学习基本空间变换，再冻结模型训练轻量级LoRA适配器学习多步规划策略，在ASCII艺术环境中优于基线方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管大语言模型具有强大的通用语言能力，但在结构化环境中的空间变换和多步规划方面仍然存在困难，特别是在导航和规划应用中需要更好的空间推理能力。

Method: 两阶段方法：1) 对基本空间变换（旋转、平移、缩放）进行监督微调，使模型具备基础空间物理知识；2) 冻结物理感知模型，在GRPO框架内训练轻量级LoRA适配器，以学习在基于谜题的环境中组合这些构建块进行多步规划的闭环策略。为此合成了ASCII艺术数据集并构建了相应的基于ASCII的强化学习环境。

Result: 该方法在动态环境（具有显式状态更新）和静态环境（模型必须依赖其内部状态）中均一致优于基线方法，包括通用骨干模型、物理感知模型和端到端RL模型。此外，与从头开始的端到端强化学习相比，该方法收敛更快且训练更稳定。注意力模式分析表明微调确实带来了空间理解的有意义改进。

Conclusion: 通过将空间推理分解为原子构建块及其组合的两阶段方法，能够有效提升大语言模型在结构化环境中的空间推理能力，为导航和规划应用提供了更可靠的解决方案。

Abstract: Spatial reasoning in large language models (LLMs) has gained increasing attention due to applications in navigation and planning. Despite strong general language capabilities, LLMs still struggle with spatial transformations and multi-step planning in structured environments. We propose a two-stage approach that decomposes spatial reasoning into atomic building blocks and their composition. First, we apply supervised fine-tuning on elementary spatial transformations, such as rotation, translation, and scaling, to equip the model with basic spatial physics. We then freeze this physics-aware model and train lightweight LoRA adapters within the GRPO framework to learn policies that compose these building blocks for multi-step planning in puzzle-based environments, in a closed-loop manner. To support this pipeline, we synthesize an ASCII-art dataset and construct a corresponding ASCII-based reinforcement learning environment. Our method consistently outperforms baselines, including the generic backbone, physics-aware model, and end-to-end RL models, under both Dynamic environments with explicit state updates and Static environments where the model must rely on its internal state across steps. In addition, the proposed approach converges faster and exhibits more stable training compared to end-to-end reinforcement learning from scratch. Finally, we analyze attention patterns to assess whether fine-tuning induces meaningful improvements in spatial understanding.

Result: 在多种最新主流大语言模型上的实验显示，在处理复杂多步骤工具调用时存在显著的性能差异

Conclusion: MCPAgentBench为评估智能体工具使用能力提供了有效基准，所有代码已开源，有助于推动自主智能体研究

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly serving as autonomous agents, and their utilization of external tools via the Model Context Protocol (MCP) is considered a future trend. Current MCP evaluation sets suffer from issues such as reliance on external MCP services and a lack of difficulty awareness. To address these limitations, we propose MCPAgentBench, a benchmark based on real-world MCP definitions designed to evaluate the tool-use capabilities of agents. We construct a dataset containing authentic tasks and simulated MCP tools. The evaluation employs a dynamic sandbox environment that presents agents with candidate tool lists containing distractors, thereby testing their tool selection and discrimination abilities. Furthermore, we introduce comprehensive metrics to measure both task completion rates and execution efficiency. Experiments conducted on various latest mainstream Large Language Models reveal significant performance differences in handling complex, multi-step tool invocations. All code is open-source at Github.

Motivation: 解决大型语言模型无法处理超出其固定上下文窗口的长提示的问题，探索推理时扩展的可能性

Method: 提出递归语言模型（RLMs）策略，将长提示视为外部环境，允许LLM以编程方式检查、分解并递归调用自身处理提示片段

Result: RLMs成功处理超出模型上下文窗口两个数量级的输入，在四个不同的长上下文任务中，即使对于较短提示，也显著优于基础LLM和常见长上下文框架，同时查询成本相当或更低

Conclusion: RLMs提供了一种有效且经济的方法来扩展LLM处理长提示的能力，通过递归推理策略实现显著的性能提升

Abstract: We study allowing large language models (LLMs) to process arbitrarily long prompts through the lens of inference-time scaling. We propose Recursive Language Models (RLMs), a general inference strategy that treats long prompts as part of an external environment and allows the LLM to programmatically examine, decompose, and recursively call itself over snippets of the prompt. We find that RLMs successfully handle inputs up to two orders of magnitude beyond model context windows and, even for shorter prompts, dramatically outperform the quality of base LLMs and common long-context scaffolds across four diverse long-context tasks, while having comparable (or cheaper) cost per query.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) perform well in language tasks but often lack collaborative awareness and struggle to optimize global performance in multi-agent settings. We present a reinforcement learning-augmented LLM agent framework that formulates cooperation as a decentralized partially observable Markov decision process (Dec-POMDP) and adopts centralized training with decentralized execution (CTDE). We introduce Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) to jointly optimize agent policies with access to global signals during training, together with a simplified joint reward that balances task quality, speed, and coordination cost. On collaborative writing and coding benchmarks, our framework delivers a 3x increase in task processing speed over single-agent baselines, 98.7% structural/style consistency in writing, and a 74.6% test pass rate in coding. The approach consistently outperforms strong multi-agent LLM baselines and provides a practical path toward reliable collaboration in complex workflows.

Abstract: Intelligent fault diagnosis has become an indispensable technique for ensuring machinery reliability. However, existing methods suffer significant performance decline in real-world scenarios where models are tested under unseen working conditions, while domain adaptation approaches are limited to their reliance on target domain samples. Moreover, most existing studies rely on single-modal sensing signals, overlooking the complementary nature of multi-modal information for improving model generalization. To address these limitations, this paper proposes a multi-modal cross-domain mixed fusion model with dual disentanglement for fault diagnosis. A dual disentanglement framework is developed to decouple modality-invariant and modality-specific features, as well as domain-invariant and domain-specific representations, enabling both comprehensive multi-modal representation learning and robust domain generalization. A cross-domain mixed fusion strategy is designed to randomly mix modality information across domains for modality and domain diversity augmentation. Furthermore, a triple-modal fusion mechanism is introduced to adaptively integrate multi-modal heterogeneous information. Extensive experiments are conducted on induction motor fault diagnosis under both unseen constant and time-varying working conditions. The results demonstrate that the proposed method consistently outperforms advanced methods and comprehensive ablation studies further verify the effectiveness of each proposed component and multi-modal fusion.

Abstract: Fault diagnosis of lithium-ion batteries is critical for system safety. While existing deep learning methods exhibit superior detection accuracy, their "black-box" nature hinders interpretability. Furthermore, restricted by binary classification paradigms, they struggle to provide root cause analysis and maintenance recommendations. To address these limitations, this paper proposes BatteryAgent, a hierarchical framework that integrates physical knowledge features with the reasoning capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs). The framework comprises three core modules: (1) A Physical Perception Layer that utilizes 10 mechanism-based features derived from electrochemical principles, balancing dimensionality reduction with physical fidelity; (2) A Detection and Attribution Layer that employs Gradient Boosting Decision Trees and SHAP to quantify feature contributions; and (3) A Reasoning and Diagnosis Layer that leverages an LLM as the agent core. This layer constructs a "numerical-semantic" bridge, combining SHAP attributions with a mechanism knowledge base to generate comprehensive reports containing fault types, root cause analysis, and maintenance suggestions. Experimental results demonstrate that BatteryAgent effectively corrects misclassifications on hard boundary samples, achieving an AUROC of 0.986, which significantly outperforms current state-of-the-art methods. Moreover, the framework extends traditional binary detection to multi-type interpretable diagnosis, offering a new paradigm shift from "passive detection" to "intelligent diagnosis" for battery safety management.

Abstract: Robotic systems for household object rearrangement often rely on latent preference models inferred from human demonstrations. While effective at prediction, these models offer limited insight into the interpretable factors that guide human decisions. We introduce an explicit formulation of object arrangement preferences along four interpretable constructs: spatial practicality (putting items where they naturally fit best in the space), habitual convenience (making frequently used items easy to reach), semantic coherence (placing items together if they are used for the same task or are contextually related), and commonsense appropriateness (putting things where people would usually expect to find them). To capture these constructs, we designed and validated a self-report questionnaire through a 63-participant online study. Results confirm the psychological distinctiveness of these constructs and their explanatory power across two scenarios (kitchen and living room). We demonstrate the utility of these constructs by integrating them into a Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) planner and show that when guided by participant-derived preferences, our planner can generate reasonable arrangements that closely align with those generated by participants. This work contributes a compact, interpretable formulation of object arrangement preferences and a demonstration of how it can be operationalized for robot planning.

Result: 在房价预测任务中，使用多模态列表数据发现的语义特征实现了12%的中位数相对误差，显著优于依赖LLM领域知识的GPT-5基线（38%误差）。在Netflix电影嵌入预测中，仅从语义描述就能达到0.59的余弦相似度，相当于传统协同过滤需要约4000个用户评分的性能。

Conclusion: GenZ成功桥接了基础模型和统计建模，通过可解释的语义特征发现数据集特定模式。该方法在预测性能上显著优于纯基础模型方法，发现的特征揭示了与模型领域知识不同的数据集特定模式，为混合建模提供了有效框架。

Abstract: We present GenZ, a hybrid model that bridges foundational models and statistical modeling through interpretable semantic features. While large language models possess broad domain knowledge, they often fail to capture dataset-specific patterns critical for prediction tasks. Our approach addresses this by discovering semantic feature descriptions through an iterative process that contrasts groups of items identified via statistical modeling errors, rather than relying solely on the foundational model's domain understanding. We formulate this as a generalized EM algorithm that jointly optimizes semantic feature descriptors and statistical model parameters. The method prompts a frozen foundational model to classify items based on discovered features, treating these judgments as noisy observations of latent binary features that predict real-valued targets through learned statistical relationships. We demonstrate the approach on two domains: house price prediction (hedonic regression) and cold-start collaborative filtering for movie recommendations. On house prices, our model achieves 12\% median relative error using discovered semantic features from multimodal listing data, substantially outperforming a GPT-5 baseline (38\% error) that relies on the LLM's general domain knowledge. For Netflix movie embeddings, our model predicts collaborative filtering representations with 0.59 cosine similarity purely from semantic descriptions -- matching the performance that would require approximately 4000 user ratings through traditional collaborative filtering. The discovered features reveal dataset-specific patterns (e.g., architectural details predicting local housing markets, franchise membership predicting user preferences) that diverge from the model's domain knowledge alone.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 养老机构的排班条件因设施而异，需要从制定排班的管理者访谈中提取设施特定的约束条件，而现有约束提取技术难以处理异常约束

Method: 使用约束模板提取各种组件的组合（如连续工作日的班次模式或员工组合），通过改变关注的天数和员工数量以及提取焦点（模式或频率）来提取多样化约束，并包含排除异常约束的机制

Result: 实验表明，该方法成功创建了满足所有硬约束的排班表，并通过避免提取异常约束减少了软约束的违反次数

Conclusion: 提出的约束模板方法能够有效提取养老机构特定的排班约束，排除异常情况，为约束规划求解器提供可用的约束条件，实现符合设施需求的护工排班

Abstract: Technologies for automatically generating work schedules have been extensively studied; however, in long-term care facilities, the conditions vary between facilities, making it essential to interview the managers who create shift schedules to design facility-specific constraint conditions. The proposed method utilizes constraint templates to extract combinations of various components, such as shift patterns for consecutive days or staff combinations. The templates can extract a variety of constraints by changing the number of days and the number of staff members to focus on and changing the extraction focus to patterns or frequency. In addition, unlike existing constraint extraction techniques, this study incorporates mechanisms to exclude exceptional constraints. The extracted constraints can be employed by a constraint programming solver to create care worker schedules. Experiments demonstrated that our proposed method successfully created schedules that satisfied all hard constraints and reduced the number of violations for soft constraints by circumventing the extraction of exceptional constraints.

Abstract: Agentic crafting requires LLMs to operate in real-world environments over multiple turns by taking actions, observing outcomes, and iteratively refining artifacts. Despite its importance, the open-source community lacks a principled, end-to-end ecosystem to streamline agent development. We introduce the Agentic Learning Ecosystem (ALE), a foundational infrastructure that optimizes the production pipeline for agent LLMs. ALE consists of three components: ROLL, a post-training framework for weight optimization; ROCK, a sandbox environment manager for trajectory generation; and iFlow CLI, an agent framework for efficient context engineering. We release ROME (ROME is Obviously an Agentic Model), an open-source agent grounded by ALE and trained on over one million trajectories. Our approach includes data composition protocols for synthesizing complex behaviors and a novel policy optimization algorithm, Interaction-based Policy Alignment (IPA), which assigns credit over semantic interaction chunks rather than individual tokens to improve long-horizon training stability. Empirically, we evaluate ROME within a structured setting and introduce Terminal Bench Pro, a benchmark with improved scale and contamination control. ROME demonstrates strong performance across benchmarks like SWE-bench Verified and Terminal Bench, proving the effectiveness of the ALE infrastructure.

Abstract: This report presents the design and implementation of a semi-automated data annotation pipeline developed within the DARTS project, whose goal is to create a large-scale, multimodal dataset of driving scenarios recorded in Polish conditions. Manual annotation of such heterogeneous data is both costly and time-consuming. To address this challenge, the proposed solution adopts a human-in-the-loop approach that combines artificial intelligence with human expertise to reduce annotation cost and duration. The system automatically generates initial annotations, enables iterative model retraining, and incorporates data anonymization and domain adaptation techniques. At its core, the tool relies on 3D object detection algorithms to produce preliminary annotations. Overall, the developed tools and methodology result in substantial time savings while ensuring consistent, high-quality annotations across different sensor modalities. The solution directly supports the DARTS project by accelerating the preparation of large annotated dataset in the project's standardized format, strengthening the technological base for autonomous vehicle research in Poland.

TL;DR: 迭代部署LLM并通过用户数据筛选进行微调，能够显著改变模型特性，在规划任务中实现技能提升和泛化能力，其机制相当于隐式强化学习


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究迭代部署大型语言模型时，用户从先前模型部署中精心筛选数据进行微调，如何影响后续模型特性，特别是探索这种机制与强化学习的理论联系及其对AI安全的影响

Method: 在多个规划领域测试迭代部署机制：初始模型部署后，用户筛选数据用于微调下一代模型，如此循环；通过理论分析揭示该过程相当于外层循环的强化学习训练，具有隐式奖励函数

Result: 规划技能显著提升，后续模型展现出涌现泛化能力，能够发现比初始模型长得多的规划方案；迭代部署机制确实实现了隐式强化学习效果

Conclusion: 迭代部署通过数据筛选而非显式奖励实现了强化学习训练，这对AI安全有重要启示：隐式奖励函数可能带来意外影响；该机制可作为显式强化学习的替代训练方案

Abstract: We show that iterative deployment of large language models (LLMs), each fine-tuned on data carefully curated by users from the previous models' deployment, can significantly change the properties of the resultant models. By testing this mechanism on various planning domains, we observe substantial improvements in planning skills, with later models displaying emergent generalization by discovering much longer plans than the initial models. We then provide theoretical analysis showing that iterative deployment effectively implements reinforcement learning (RL) training in the outer-loop (i.e. not as part of intentional model training), with an implicit reward function. The connection to RL has two important implications: first, for the field of AI safety, as the reward function entailed by repeated deployment is not defined explicitly, and could have unexpected implications to the properties of future model deployments. Second, the mechanism highlighted here can be viewed as an alternative training regime to explicit RL, relying on data curation rather than explicit rewards.

Conclusion: STAgent通过专门的工具环境、高质量数据筛选和级联训练方法，成功创建了一个既能解决复杂时空任务又能保持通用能力的智能体大语言模型

Abstract: We present STAgent, an agentic large language model tailored for spatio-temporal understanding, designed to solve complex tasks such as constrained point-of-interest discovery and itinerary planning. STAgent is a specialized model capable of interacting with ten distinct tools within spatio-temporal scenarios, enabling it to explore, verify, and refine intermediate steps during complex reasoning. Notably, STAgent effectively preserves its general capabilities. We empower STAgent with these capabilities through three key contributions: (1) a stable tool environment that supports over ten domain-specific tools, enabling asynchronous rollout and training; (2) a hierarchical data curation framework that identifies high-quality data like a needle in a haystack, curating high-quality queries with a filter ratio of 1:10,000, emphasizing both diversity and difficulty; and (3) a cascaded training recipe that starts with a seed SFT stage acting as a guardian to measure query difficulty, followed by a second SFT stage fine-tuned on queries with high certainty, and an ultimate RL stage that leverages data of low certainty. Initialized with Qwen3-30B-A3B to establish a strong SFT foundation and leverage insights into sample difficulty, STAgent yields promising performance on TravelBench while maintaining its general capabilities across a wide range of general benchmarks, thereby demonstrating the effectiveness of our proposed agentic model.
